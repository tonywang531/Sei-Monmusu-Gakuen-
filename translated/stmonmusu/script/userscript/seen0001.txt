1:ShinkÅgHmm, this must be the place, right?Åh
2:I gaze at the grand view in front of me and hesitate.
3:Not seeing any people, I worry that maybe this isn't the right place after all.
4:Well, since the academy is on spring break right now, that could explain why no students are around...
5:ShinkÅgThough if I recall correctly, this is a boarding school. Aren't the dorms and the academy on the same campus?Åh
6:That's what I remember the information I was sent saying, at least.
7:In that case, it is kind of weird that I don't see anyone.
8:At least a few students should still be here. Besides, the new semester is starting soon.
9:ShinkÅgYeah... Is this really going to work out? Why was a new teacher like me given such an important post in the first place?Åh
10:See, this isn't a normal academy. In fact, all the students who attend are monster girls.
11:The teachers, too. Everyone here is a female monster of some type. What's a human doing here, especially a male like me?
12:ShinkÅgNo, I know full well why I'm here.Åh
13:I'm supposed to teach human history to monsters. It's the first step in building a favorable relationship between our species.
14:I can sympathize with that idea, which is why I applied for the job.
15:ShinkÅgThough I didn't expect to be the ONLY human here.Åh
16:I had thought there were other teachers before me, but it seems I'm the guinea pig.
17:I wanted to complain about how this needed more planning or something, but there has to be a first time for everything.
18:On that subject, it's also kind of absurd for me to complain when I'm the one who applied in the first place.
19:ShinkÅgThat's right. There's no point in holding back now.Åh
20:I put away my misgivings and step onto campus.
21:If I remember right, they prepared a room for me and told me to head there first.
22:ShinkÅgI think the room is in the dorms.Åh
23:With my head down glued to the map of campus in my hand, I continue forward indecisively.
24:I'm half worried, half excited to find out what's going to happen to me here.
25:ÅHÅHÅHÅgOutta my waaaaaaaaaaay!!Åh
26:ShinkÅgEh...? Wha, whoooooa!?Åh
27:ÅHÅHÅHÅgSorry! Sorrrrry! Don't mind meee!!Åh
28:ShinkÅgWh-what the..?Åh
29:I take a blow from out of nowhere and am knocked on my ass.
30:Moreover, the girl who did it keeps running straight without so much as looking over her shoulder back at me.
31:I suppose she's a student, but I didn't get a clear look at her.
32:ShinkÅgWell, this isn't the time to worry about that.Åh
33:I'm going to be late at this rate.
34:I'll probably be able to find out who that girl is once school starts.
35:ShinkÅgStill... what a bad way to start my tenure.Åh
36:I quickly brush the dust off my suit and break out into a quick pace towards my destination.
37:ShinkÅgExcuse me...Åh
38:Vice Pres.ÅgAah, I've been expecting you. Professor Shink Celestite, I presume?Åh
39:ShinkÅgY-yes. This is my first day on the job. I'm inexperienced and know I have a lot to learn so please bear with me.Åh
40:I hear a voice upon entering the room and instinctively exchange greetings.
41:At that point, I glance around the room. Other than me, the only people here are a young woman and one in the prime of her life.
42:As I expected, meeting them for the first time is incredibly nerve-wracking.
43:Vice Pres.ÅgThere's no need to be nervous. No one here is going to eat you or anything.Åh
44:ShinkÅgR-right...Åh
45:Just because she isn't going to eat me doesn't make it any easier to calm down.
46:No matter what she says, the woman in front of me is very intimidating.
47:She's simply standing there and acting normally, though. Is this a monster's innate air of intimidation, I wonder?
48:Vice Pres.ÅgHuhu. Getting down to business, I'm the academy's vice president. Normally the principal would greet you, but he's a bit busy. Our apologies.Åh
49:ShinkÅgIt's all right. I already heard that he was busy.Åh
50:If I'm not mistaken, the principal is human. The sister school takes more time to manage so I've heard that he only rarely makes an appearance here.
51:However, he must be an amazing man to create this academy to promote human-monster coexistence.
52:Vice Pres.ÅgThank you for understanding. I know I've been told why you've come to our school, but I can't quite...Åh
53:ShinkÅgAh, you heard that I teach human history, right?Åh
54:Vice Pres.ÅgThat's it. Without any human teachers at the academy, we're embarrassed to be completely ignorant of that subject.Åh
55:Vice Pres.ÅgSo we're extremely grateful to have you aboard to help.Åh
56:ShinkÅgNo, it's entirely my pleasure to be given the opportunity to teach here.Åh
57:It's probably going to be difficult, but I can definitely sympathize with the founding principles of this institution. 
58:I'm lucky just to be able to teach here.
59:Vice Pres.ÅgIs that right? I'm glad to hear it.Åh
60:Vice Pres.ÅgIt also puts my mind at ease to entrust the students to such a fine young man.Åh
61:ShinkÅgR-really? Thank you very much.Åh
62:It's kind of embarrassing to be told something like that face-to-face.
63:Whether she realizes that I'm embarrassed or not, the vice president drops an unexpected bomb.
64:Vice Pres.ÅgI've also decided to put you in charge of that class. No, I'm delighted to do so.Åh
65:ShinkÅgHuh? In... charge...?Åh
He's been chosen as a class's homeroom teacher. All I know about Japanese high school I learned from anime and VNs, which isn't much. This homeroom teacher / in charge thing comes up a lot.
66:Vice Pres.ÅgYes. I'm ashamed to admit it, but there are some students we just don't know how to deal with. We put them in a class but didn't have anyone in charge of it.Åh
67:ShinkÅgUhh... come again?Åh
68:Wait, wait a second. Don't tell me...
69:Vice Pres.ÅgBut that's taken care of now, and I can rest assured.Åh
70:ShinkÅgHold on a minute! You, you know I'm completely new at this, right!? And I'm human!Åh
71:Haha, she's kidding right? Even in ideal circumstances, being a new teacher is tough, but being in charge of a bunch of monster troublemakers!?
72:This is completely unreasonable!
73:Vice Pres.ÅgIt'll be fine. Even though you're new, I know you're the right man for the job.Åh
74:ShinkÅgWhat? What makes you so sure of that!Åh
75:Vice Pres.ÅgHohoho, excellent. That's a load off my shoulders. I'll leave the rest to you, Professor Kyute.Åh
76:KyuteÅgYes ma'am.Åh
77:ShinkÅgWait..!?Åh
78:Damn, she wasn't listening to a word I said!
79:At this rate I'm going to be put in charge without any say in the matter!
80:ShinkÅgVice president! Listen to me! Please listen!Åh
81:Vice Pres.ÅgHohoho. Well then, Professor Shink, I've got to run so please direct any further questions to Professor Kyute here.Åh
82:ShinkÅgWait, vice president!? Vice presideeeeeeent!!Åh
83:As if not hearing me shout after her, the vice president leaves the room with a look of innocence on her face.
84:With my hand reaching out towards her, I stiffen like I've been turned to stone.
85:H-how did this happen to me...
86:KyuteÅgUmm, are you going to be all right?Åh
87:ShinkÅgEh...? Ah, aah, I'm sorry.Åh
88:After standing paralyzed for a minute, a nearby voice brings me back to reality.
89:What a disgrace. No matter how unexpected the situation was, I can't believe I acted like that.
90:ShinkÅgI'm so sorry you had to see that.Åh
91:KyuteÅgNo, it's fine. Anyone would be upset to have that sprung on him.Åh
92:ShinkÅgThat's a relief to hear...Åh
93:Fortunately it seems that Ms. Kyute has some common sense.
94:That's good to know. Even among monsters, everyone is different. They aren't all like the vice president.
95:KyuteÅgWell then, since the vice president left the rest to me, let's get you up to speed.Åh
96:ShinkÅgAh, right. Err, you probably heard earlier, but I'm Shink Celestite. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.Åh
97:KyuteÅgOh, how very polite. I'm Kyute Otokane. We're about the same age so there's no need to act so formal.Åh
98:ShinkÅgIs that so? But that doesn't change the fact that you have seniority here.Åh
99:KyuteÅgFrom your perspective, I suppose that's true...Åh
She's trying to say that she's rather new too, but he's right that he's newer than her.
100:ShinkÅgSee? I'll try to avoid being too stiff as best as I can though.Åh
101:It'd probably look bad to dispense with formalities in public, after all.
102:But since she's asking me herself, I suppose I can manage around her. I'll just have to be flexible.
103:KyuteÅgThanks, I appreciate it.Åh
104:Kyute smiles and holds out a wing towards me.
105:Umm, what exactly is she asking me to do?
106:KyuteÅgHuhu, let's shake hands. It wouldn't do to not greet each other properly.Åh
107:ShinkÅgAh, aaah... I see. The pleasure is mine.Åh
108:Finally understanding what she meant, I reach out my hand and grasp Kyute's wing.
109:The sensation of her soft plumage on my skin makes me feel strange.
110:ShinkÅgI never thought I'd end up shaking hands with a monster. It's a rather strange feeling.Åh
Strange feeling same phrase in both lines, like he's trying to justify the feeling in his head by speaking a possibility out loud.
111:KyuteÅgAah, it must be. My father's a human so this kind of thing is perfectly normal to me.Åh
More like "I picked up this common social practice because of him, you see?"
112:ShinkÅgAh, so you're half human. That's really...Åh
113:Should I say "unusual?" Maybe not these days, but there aren't many in our generation.
114:ShinkÅgWait, Otokane, you said?Åh
115:KyuteÅgHuhu, that's right. The same as the founder and principal of this academy. I'm Hibiki Otokane's daughter.Åh
116:ShinkÅgAh, I see...Åh
117:It seemed strange for a human to found an academy like this, but maybe she's the reason?
118:I can understand that. Knowing he did it for his daughter, I have even more respect for the principal now.
119:KyuteÅgWell then, shall I show you around campus a bit? I assume you haven't learned where things are yet.Åh
120:ShinkÅgAh, that'd be great, thanks. I'm completely lost around here.Åh
121:KyuteÅgLet's go then. Please follow me.Åh
122:With a smile, Kyute turns and walks out of the room with me on her heels.
123:Come to think of it, the matter of me being in charge of a class still isn't settled... Is that really going to work out?
124:KyuteÅgHere we are. This is the room for the class you're in charge of so please make sure you don't forget where it is.Åh
125:ShinkÅgSo I really am going to be in charge of them?Åh
126:KyuteÅgAhaha. I'm not in a position to do anything about that.Åh
127:ShinkÅgNo, it's all right. I've come this far so it's too late to back out now.Åh
128:Yeah. There's no point making meaningless complaints about things I have no control over. I don't like it, but I'll have to try to make do.
129:KyuteÅgYes, please do your best to manage. I'll help you as much as I can too.Åh
130:ShinkÅgI'd appreciate that a lot.Åh
131:Kyute smiles as she gives me encouragement. I thank her and look around my new classroom.
132:The desks are divided between tall and short, and some are lacking chairs.
133:I assume those are for some of the students who don't need to sit down.
134:ShinkÅgHuh, it's more normal than I expected.Åh
135:KyuteÅgOf course. What were you expecting a classroom to look like?Åh
136:ShinkÅgNo, it's just...Åh
137:Kyute replies with a sarcastic laugh. Turning red, I stammer in embarrassment.
138:I can't very well tell her that I was imagining something much more bizarre.
139:ShinkÅgThat reminds me, I haven't seen any students around...Åh
140:KyuteÅgAh yes, it's spring break and most of the students are back home. Some of them are back already, but secluded in their rooms.Åh
141:ShinkÅgI see.Åh
142:That makes sense. What student would willingly come to school during a break?
143:That's no different than any human academy.
144:KyuteÅgWell then, on to our next destination?Åh
145:ShinkÅgYes, thanks.Åh
146:ShinkÅgIt's huge!Åh
147:In front of me are mountains and mountains of books!
148:As one would expect from this place, the huge collection of books is spectacular.
149:KyuteÅgThe Grand Library is the pride of our school. I don't know the exact number of volumes it contains, but it's a considerable number.Åh
150:ShinkÅgI can see that. It rivals the Imperial Library itself... No, it may even be bigger.Åh
151:KyuteÅgMaybe so, but most of the books are related to monsters. It's not very useful for learning about humans.Åh
152:ShinkÅgI see. So that's why you want a human teaching here?Åh
153:KyuteÅgExactly.Åh
154:ShinkÅgThat makes sense...Åh
155:How convenient it must be to have all of this at your disposal.
156:Though for the time being, I'm relieved to see that I have some job security.
157:While pondering all that, I follow Kyute out of the Grand Library.
158:Next time I come back, I'll have to spend some time checking out the books.
159:KyuteÅgThis is the roof. In order to get to the sky arena over there, you have to pass through here.Åh
160:ShinkÅgArena?Åh
161:KyuteÅgThat's right. Think of it like the sporting grounds at a human academy.Åh
162:ShinkÅgAaah, your athletic field, then.Åh
163:Then again, that's an extremely amazing-looking field.
164:How is it floating there by itself in the first place?
165:KyuteÅgAh, are you wondering how it floats?Åh
166:ShinkÅgUh, was my face that easy to read?Åh
167:KyuteÅgYes. It floats through the use of monster science.Åh
168:ShinkÅgMonster science? It isn't some fancy new technology? Why isn't this being used anywhere else?Åh
169:KyuteÅgAhaha. That's because the developer is a staff member here at the academy.
170:ShinkÅgSeriously?Åh
171:That's just... amazing on a completely different scale.
172:KyuteÅgWell now... Shall we head up there?Åh
173:ShinkÅgHead up there? On that rainbow-looking thing? If I fall...Åh
174:KyuteÅgDon't worry. I'm here even if that happens.Åh
175:ShinkÅgI notice you didn't reassure me that falling isn't possible...Åh
176:KyuteÅgHmmm, well a few people do fall off every year... but not very many.Åh
177:ShinkÅg...I see.Åh
178:So people do fall off that thing. How safe is this...
179:There's a huge difference in the average strength and physical capacity of humans and monsters.
180:Be that as it may, I suppose I can't put this off forever. I'll just have to tough it out.
181:ShinkÅgAll right, let's go.Åh
182:KyuteÅgHuhu, let's take it nice and slow then.Åh
183:Despite misgivings about how honest Kyute is being with me, I step onto the path extending out to the sky arena.
184:ShinkÅgWow, this place is huge too...Åh
185:We finally reach the arena after walking at a timidly slow pace. Upon arriving, my fear disappears, replaced by marvel at the arena's size.
186:As expected from an arena, it's completely surrounded with seats for the audience.
187:Just imagining the various events that take place here takes my breath away.
188:KyuteÅgHuhu, you look quite surprised.Åh
189:ShinkÅgOf course. It's rare to see such a huge open space.Åh
190:KyuteÅgThat's true. As civilization has progressed, the land has become more and more developed.Åh
191:ShinkÅgI bet all the events held here are amazing to watch.Åh
192:KyuteÅgThey sure are! I hope you're looking forward to attending.Åh
193:ShinkÅgDefinitely. Shall we continue the tour?Åh
194:KyuteÅgGladly.Åh
195:As we head back down the path to the academy building, the spectacle of events held here comes to life in my mind.
196:Still not accustomed to the rainbow bridge, it took quite awhile to get back, by the way.
197:KyuteÅgThis is the dining hall. Most of the teachers and students take their meals here.Åh
198:ShinkÅgWow, what a lavish dining hall.Åh
199:KyuteÅgNot just the appearance either. The food here is very delicious.Åh
200:ShinkÅgHmmm.Åh
201:From looking at Kyute's face, I can see she's telling the truth about the food.
202:There's one little problem on my mind though.
203:ShinkÅgDo they serve food... for humans too?Åh
204:KyuteÅg...? Of course they do. Were you actually worried about that?Åh
205:ShinkÅgAaah. Yeah, a little.Åh
206:KyuteÅgHuhu, don't worry. They prepare plenty of meals for students who enjoy human cuisine.Åh
207:ShinkÅgI see. That's a relief.Åh
208:As I should have expected from an academy focused on coexistence. They wouldn't make such an obvious oversight.
209:KyuteÅgGood, good. Monster cuisine is quite tasty as well so please give it a try if you're interested.Åh
210:ShinkÅgI'll keep that in mind.Åh
211:I actually am interested in what they eat. If I get tired of regular food, I'll check it out.
212:KyuteÅgAnd this is my room.Åh
213:ShinkÅgEh, huh... Whaaa?Åh
214:Why is she showing me her room? Don't tell me she likes me or something...
215:ShinkÅgErrr, sorry.Åh
216:I'm not such a lonely guy to misunderstand things that badly. Plus, there's no way something like that would happen when we've only just met.
I don't understand the first sentence. It could be a negative or a positive exclamation chastising himself in some way.
217:ShinkÅgUmm, why did we come to your room, Ms. Kyute?Åh
218:KyuteÅgAh, sorry about that. In addition to being my room, it's also the infirmary.Åh
219:ShinkÅgOh, I see. It's the infirmary.Åh
220:Now that she mentions it, I can see medicines and various supplies on the shelves.
221:ShinkÅgSo that means you studied pharmacology?Åh
222:KyuteÅgYes, I may not look like it, but I'm a qualified physician.Åh
223:ShinkÅgWow, that's amazing for someone so young.Åh
224:KyuteÅgNo no, I just had a great teacher.Åh
225:ShinkÅgYour teacher, huh?Åh
226:Her teacher must have been top-notch for her to be a doctor at such a young age.
227:KyuteÅgIf you're hurt or feeling unwell, please come see me right away.Åh
228:KyuteÅgJust being human, there are lots of ways you can get hurt.Åh
229:ShinkÅgOh, is that right...Åh
230:Are humans more likely to get injured when they're around monsters perhaps?
231:I guess it's natural that something which might be no big deal for a monster could be dangerous to me.
232:ShinkÅgUnderstood. Thanks in advance.Åh
233:KyuteÅgDon't be shy about it. I have lots of medicine for humans, but I've never gotten to try them out.Åh
234:ShinkÅg...I see.Åh
235:Seeing the bright smile on Kyute's face, I resolve to try my hardest to avoid needing to come here.
236:ShinkÅgWhat a luxurious bath. It's so large.Åh
237:KyuteÅgIndeed. Well, there are lots of students, after all.Åh
238:ShinkÅgMakes sense.Åh
239:I suppose it wouldn't be feasible to have individual baths for everyone.
240:In that case, a large public path makes a lot of sense.
241:ShinkÅgIt looks like I'd better carefully consider when to bathe, given the circumstances.Åh
242:KyuteÅgAround this time should be fine. The students' bathing hours are fixed so you may enter any time after that.Åh
243:ShinkÅgAll right.Åh
244:Good to know. If I ran into a student here, I'd be branded a total pervert.
245:I'll have to be very careful around the bath.
246:KyuteÅgJust in case, please make sure you hang this card outside when you enter.Åh
247:ShinkÅgWill do.Åh
248:I nod my head in assent at the 'Male Currently in Bath' card Kyute is holding.
249:The more precautions I take around here, the better.
250:KyuteÅgAnd now we're back where we started.Åh
251:ShinkÅgThank you very much for the tour. That was a big help.Åh
252:KyuteÅgNo, it was nothing. I'm heading back to my room now. Please call if you need anything.Åh
253:ShinkÅgThanks. I think I'm just going to spend some time unpacking and straightening out my things.Åh
254:KyuteÅgAll right. Oh, one more thing. There isn't any rule against it, but please avoid the student quarter as best you can.Åh
255:ShinkÅgNaturally.Åh
256:This is a female-only academy, after all, so all the students are girls.
257:Putting aside the fact that a human can't match them in physical strength, I wouldn't do something as stupid as wander into a girl's living area.
258:KyuteÅgThanks for understanding. See you tomorrow then.Åh
259:ShinkÅgThank you for everything.Åh
260:Kyute makes a slight bow as she leaves my room. Watching her go, I breathe a sigh of relief.
261:That was really tiring. Not so much physically, but the mental strain of being in a completely foreign atmosphere was intense.
262:ShinkÅgAfter all that, I already need a vacation.Åh
263:It looks like my room has already been set up to some extent, but a few of my belongings need to be put away.
264:If I don't do it today, I have a feeling I might end up living like a slob. I guess I better unpack now then.
265:ShinkÅgAll right, first on the list is...Åh
266:I get fired up and start organizing my room.
267:ShinkÅgWhew, that took a lot longer than I expected.Åh
268:After cleaning things up, I head outside to stretch my tired muscles.
269:The sun has already set, and moonlight faintly shines.
270:ShinkÅgIt's going to start soon...Åh
271:I gaze dreamily into the sky and fantasize about my new life as a teacher.
272:"Is everything going to work out?" is the only thing on my mind.
273:ÅHÅHÅHÅgHuhu, what's the matter, I wonder? That anxious look spoils your handsome face, you know?Åh
274:ShinkÅgHuh...?Åh
275:Unexpectedly receiving a reply to my monologue, I look around in surprise.
276:However, I don't see anyone around, not even a shadow.
277:ShinkÅg...?Åh
278:ÅHÅHÅHÅgHuhuhu. Not there. Look up, up!Åh
279:ShinkÅg...up?Åh
280:I obey the laughing voice and turn my gaze upward.
281:ÅHÅHÅHÅgBoo!Åh
282:ShinkÅg...ah!?Åh
283:After a moment, the face of a girl appears close to mine, causing me to scream wordlessly and jump back.
284:ÅHÅHÅHÅgHuhu, scared you. That was a great reaction, by the way.Åh
285:ShinkÅgY-you're floating... No legs either...Åh
286:No, there's nothing particularly unusual about floating. Even Kyute can fly.
287:But not having any legs... On top of that, her body is rather transparent. Is she...
288:ShinkÅgA ghost?Åh
289:PhamÅgYep, that's me. Ghost, specter, phantom, call me whatever you'd like. My name is Pham, though. It'd make me happy if you used it.Åh
290:ShinkÅgA-are you... a student?Åh
291:PhamÅgHmm, I wonder. What do you think, Shink Celestite?Åh
292:ShinkÅgEh? How do you know my name...Åh
293:This is definitely our first meeting. At least I don't remember ever encountering a ghost before.
294:Someone I knew when she was alive...? That's not it either. I don't remember any childhood friends named Pham.
295:PhamÅgRelax. We've never met before.Åh
296:ShinkÅgThen why do you know my name?Åh
297:PhamÅgHuhu, there's nothing I don't know at this academy.Åh
298:ShinkÅg......Åh
299:I'm not quite sure what she's implying by that, but I guess she's just well-informed?
300:PhamÅgThat's right. You're sharp.Åh
301:ShinkÅg...!?Åh
302:Did she read my mind?
303:PhamÅgOh, don't act so guarded. I don't have any ill intentions towards you.Åh
304:ShinkÅgIs that so...?Åh
305:PhamÅgYep. I just wanted to make my debut today.Åh
306:ShinkÅgDebut?Åh
307:PhamÅgYes, my debut. A new breeze. The only human. The one who will change this beloved place. Will it be a good change in the end...Åh
Obviously not supposed to make a lot of sense given the next line.
308:ShinkÅg......?Åh
309:Wh-what in the world is she talking about? I don't understand her at all...
310:PhamÅgDon't worry about it. I've accomplished my objective.Åh
311:ShinkÅgYour objective? The debut?Åh
312:PhamÅgYes, and to make sure... I have high hopes for you, Shink Celestite. Please do your best.Åh
313:ShinkÅg...ah, aaah.Åh
314:I don't understand half of what she says, but I guess she's giving me encouragement?
315:Come to think of it, all of my earlier anxiety has completely faded away.
316:ShinkÅgI don't get it, but I'll try. Thank you.Åh
317:PhamÅgHuhu, I don't remember doing anything worth being thanked for.Åh
318:PhamÅgWell then, I bid you farewell. Until we meet again.Åh
319:ShinkÅgAaah...Åh
320:Pham hurriedly says goodbye and disappears, melting back into the night.
321:I don't know whether she was in a hurry or had some other reason, but she's definitely an enigmatic girl.
322:ShinkÅgWhew... Well, whatever.Åh
323:I've gotten sleepy out here, and I guess there's no need to think too hard about her.
324:Oh yeah, I haven't bathed either. I wonder if I can do that tomorrow morning?
325:I doubt anyone will be in there if I go at the crack of dawn.
326:ShinkÅgNow then, I'd better start preparing lessons.Åh
327:There are only a few days left of spring break. I'll have to think about how to introduce myself and stuff like that.
328:There's a lot to do, but that comes with the job. I'll tough it out, hopefully.
329:ShinkÅgAh, aaaaoooooh!Åh
330:The light shining through my window wakes me up. I yawn and stretch out to loosen up.
331:I slept soundly, perhaps because of all the tension and fatigue I had built up. Yeah, I feel great this morning.
332:ShinkÅgLet's see... It's still really early. I guess it'll be fine to bathe now.Åh
333:I check my watch, quickly get ready, and head to the bath.
334:ShinkÅgWoo, this warm water is great.Åh
335:Immersed under water in the bathtub, I feel my strength draining like my tiredness is washing away.
336:With the card hung at the entrance, I let time pass by. There's no need to be on guard here.
337:ShinkÅgMan, isn't it nice to be able to monopolize the bath like this?Åh
338:Being the only guy around definitely has its perks.
339:If I can feel this liberated every day, it seems like it was good to come here. This is such a calm, peaceful place.
340:ShinkÅgHmm, all right. Guess I should get out now.Åh
341:I'm not the type to take a long bath, plus I really do need to prepare for classes.
342:ÅHÅHÅHÅgHuaaa... so sleepy. I'm so bad with mornings. I can barely open my eyes.Åh
343:ÅHÅHÅHÅgYou're always like that, Bibi. You look half asleep all day long.Åh
344:BibiÅgAah, is that so? I just hate being bored. Shirene, find something interesting for me.Åh
345:ShireneÅgNo way. And don't talk like you're my boss either.Åh
346:BibiÅgImpossible. This is just the way I am. Being polite would be preposterous.Åh
347:ShireneÅgSigh, whatever. Reasoning with you is hopeless.Åh
348:BibiÅgThat's right. Accept it.Åh
349:ShinkÅg...huh?Åh
350:W-wait a second... I can hear voices from outside... and, whoooa!?
351:ShinkÅgOh crap... b-but I put the card out and everything!?Åh
352:ShireneÅgBy the way, what were you hiding earlier?Åh
353:BibiÅgAaah, this thing. Seems like the previous bather left it. It says not to enter because the bath is being used.Åh
354:ShireneÅgWhat's with that? What kind of pompous ass would try to hog a public place all for herself?Åh
355:BibiÅgHeheh, must be a newbie. We'll have to teach her some basic manners.Åh
356:ShireneÅgDefinitely. But let's hurry up. No matter how many times I tell you, you take way too long in the ba...th?
357:ShinkÅg...Åh
358:Flustered, I don't even have time to hide before I'm face to face with two girls.
359:Given that this is the bathroom, naturally they're both stark naked...
360:...it's all over. Now what do I do? For starters, cover my front I guess?
361:ShireneÅg...a human?Åh
362:BibiÅgYep, it's a human. A male too.Åh
363:ShireneÅgRight. Definitely a human man... man?Åh
364:Shit. I'm a dead man.
365:ShireneÅgMmmmmmaaaaaaaan!?Åh
366:BibiÅgYou're slow.Åh
367:ShireneÅgHow are you so calm! It's a man! G-got to cover up! I don't have a towel!!Åh
368:BibiÅgCalm down. You have hands, sheesh. You always freak out when you get the least bit flustered.Åh
369:ShinkÅgUmm...Åh
370:Now what? Apologize? Or try to explain myself...
371:ShireneÅgOooh! Calm down!? Kill him! I'm going to kill him right now!!Åh
372:ShinkÅgHold on! I'm not a pervert or anything! I even put the card out front!Åh
373:BibiÅgAaah, it does say that. Male Currently in Bath.Åh
374:ShireneÅgWhy didn't you say so earlier!Åh
375:BibiÅgI thought it'd be fun not to. I'm satisfied.Åh
376:ShireneÅgDon't brag about it! And cover up your front while you're at it!Åh
377:BibiÅgWhy? Being seen doesn't bother me so there's no reason to hide.Åh
378:ShireneÅgHave a little modesty, why don't you!Åh
379:ShinkÅg......Åh
380:BibiÅgHeheh... Hey, shouldn't you be running away?Åh
381:ShinkÅgUh... not a bad idea...Åh
382:If they make a fuss over this, my life as a teacher is certainly over.
383:As the bee girl said, escaping would be prudent.
384:ShinkÅgI'm sorry, by the way!Åh
385:ShireneÅgUgh, are you planning to run!?Åh
386:BibiÅgIt looks like it. Hey, run away, run! Chase after him, go!Åh
387:ShinkÅgWhat are you trying to stir up!?Åh
388:I thought she was trying to tempt me, but I never imagined she wanted to enjoy watching me suffer!
389:BibiÅgHeheh, are you going to entertain me now?Åh
390:ShinkÅgDamn it! I was right!Åh
391:Why did this happen to me! Well, this isn't the time to worry about that.
392:I have to get my clothes on and get out of here. If she catches me, I don't know what she'll do!
393:ShireneÅgNgh, I'm not letting you out of here!Åh
394:I start running out of the bathroom like a rabbit being chased by a coyote.
395:ShinkÅgHaaa, haaa!Åh
396:Despite being out of breath, I dash down the hall at full speed.
397:Judging from her looks, the girl I pissed off was a centaur.
398:Therefore, no matter how far I run, she'll probably be able to catch up.
399:I've got to find somewhere to hide!
400:ShinkÅgHey, wait a second. Why am I running...!?Åh
401:When I think about it calmly, wasn't running away a really bad idea?
402:Stirring up a commotion will only make people think I'm some kind of degenerate!
403:ShinkÅgAh, arrrrrgh! She set me up!!Åh
404:That bee girl! She took advantage of the confusion to lead me into making the worst decision possible!
405:ShinkÅgShiiiit!!Åh
406:Nothing I can do about that now. I'd better find Kyute somehow and explain myself...!
407:ÅHÅHÅHÅg...ugh!?Åh
408:ShinkÅgOops, whoa!?Åh
409:Probably because I was running while thinking, I didn't notice someone coming around the corner and slammed right into her.
410:With a loud impact, I collapse and roll to the ground.
411:ShinkÅgS-sorry! Are you all... right?Åh
412:Still on the ground, I quickly look over at the person I hit in a panic.
413:However... all I see are the scattered pieces of a girl...
414:ShinkÅgWhat the hell!!!??Åh
415:H-hold on a second!? Did I really tear someone to pieces just from running into her!?
416:Just how fast was I going!? Not only am I a pervert, but now I've attained the rank of murderer too!?
Murderer rank GET! You can see with the next line that it's supposed to have a positive connotation.
417:ShinkÅgThat's not something to celebrate!!Åh
418:ÅHÅHÅHÅgOh, why am I looking up from the ground?Åh
419:ShinkÅgShe spoke...!?Åh
420:ÅHÅHÅHÅgAah, I must have fallen. I was walking while engrossed in a book. My mistake, my mistake.Åh
So Comet has this way of speaking where she doubles words for emphasis. It sounds good in Japanese, rarely in English.
421:ÅHÅHÅHÅgHeave-ho! ...oh, hmm? I can't move. Why is that? Very strange, very strange.Åh
422:ShinkÅg......Åh
423:She seems like she lives in her own world... Perhaps she hasn't noticed me yet?
424:It looks like she's all right somehow. Maybe I should apologize and run away...?
425:ÅHÅHÅHÅgOh. How did my body come apart? This is a problem. I'll die like this.Åh
426:ShinkÅgYou'll die!? You aren't all right!?Åh
427:ÅHÅHÅHÅgIt's the noisy human from earlier. You think I can live like this? Are you an idiot?Åh
428:ShinkÅgUhh, I guess so. Ummm, what should I do...Åh
429:ÅHÅHÅHÅgOh well, it's not like I'm going to die.Åh
430:ShinkÅgWhich is it!?Åh
431:ÅHÅHÅHÅgIt's a joke. Nice joke.Åh
She says that in English.
432:ShinkÅg.........Åh
433:What's with this girl... She's hard to deal with, or maybe I should say I don't understand her.
434:ÅHÅHÅHÅgOh, it doesn't seem that it went over well. Too bad. I'll have to be serious then.Åh
435:ÅHÅHÅHÅgFirst of all, please attach my legs. I'll be fine if I can move.Åh
436:ShinkÅgAh, aaah... Errr, is this a leg...Åh
437:CometÅgHaaa, haaa. You're touching Comet's leg. Haaa, haaa, so good...Åh
438:ShinkÅgWill you stop moaning in a weird voice!?Åh
439:CometÅgYou ran into me. Nothing wrong with getting a little revenge.Åh
440:ShinkÅg...I suppose not.Åh
441:I'm certainly the one at fault so I can suffer at least that much.
442:Anyway, I'd better hurry before that centaur finds me.
443:CometÅgAh, you saved me. Thanks.Åh
444:ShinkÅgNo, it was my fault in the first place.Åh
445:CometÅgOh, unexpectedly laudable behavior. I'm surprised.Åh
446:ShinkÅg......Åh
447:What on Earth do I look like to deserve such impudence from everyone...?
'How am I seen from their eyes' or some such.
448:ShireneÅgWhere are youuuuuu!Åh
449:ShinkÅgShit! Sorry, but I've got to run!Åh
450:CometÅg...?Åh
451:The doll girl gives me a look that says she has no idea what's going on. I quickly apologize and sprint away.
452:Damn... Where can I go to get away from her?
453:CometÅgWhat's going on here?Åh
454:ShireneÅgAh, Comet! Did you see a pervert come through here!?Åh
455:CometÅgA pervert? I didn't.Åh
456:ShireneÅgOh... grr, where did he run off to! Sorry for bothering you.Åh
457:CometÅgNo problem. Later.Åh
458:ShireneÅgYeah, later. Where is heeee!!Åh
459:CometÅgLots of strange things happening today.Åh
460:BibiÅgBy the way, why are you in your uniform?Åh
461:CometÅgI was going to the library. Is something wrong with it?Åh
462:BibiÅgNot really. So, did you really not see him? It's unusual to see a human male so I thought you'd be interested.Åh
463:CometÅg...? I saw a human male. He wasn't a pervert.Åh
464:BibiÅgAah. I guess we asked the wrong question. Now, where did Shirene go?Åh
465:CometÅgYou aren't going to chase him?Åh
466:BibiÅgI've lost interest. It doesn't seem like much fun anymore. I'm just going to take a nap.Åh
467:CometÅgAh, well I want to read my book. Bye.Åh
468:ShinkÅgHaaa, haaa... Dammit.Åh
469:It's good that I made it outside, but she'll definitely catch me out here.
470:I've got to do something, but I have no idea what.
471:ShireneÅgWhere are you at! Outside!?Åh
472:ShinkÅg...! Damn she's perceptive!Åh
473:Maybe because she's a monster she has keen wild instincts or something!
474:ShinkÅgWhere can I hide...Åh
475:I hurriedly look around the vicinity and spot an open window near the corner of the dorms.
476:ShinkÅg...screw it, this is an emergency!Åh
477:Figuring it's better than being caught, I dash at full speed, plant my foot on the windowsill and dive into the room.
478:ÅHÅHÅHÅg......Åh
479:ShinkÅgUm...Åh
480:As soon as I plunge through the window, I see a girl inside inside the room with me.
481:She's peacefully reading a book and doesn't appear to have noticed my intrusion.
482:Nevertheless, I find myself in an awkward situation...
483:ÅHÅHÅHÅgHuh...? A... human?Åh
484:ShinkÅgAh, aaah... Sorry for barging in...Åh
485:This is bad... Is she going to follow the same pattern of screaming at me!?
486:ÅHÅHÅHÅgAah, I heard we were getting a human teacher next term. Is that you?Åh
487:ShinkÅgEh...? Ah, aah... actually, yes.Åh
488:ÅHÅHÅHÅgI knew it. Heh, welcome. You surprised me a little coming in through the window like that.Åh
489:ShinkÅgAhhh... well, I had a reason for that, you see...Åh
490:ShireneÅgWhere are you, pervert! Stop hiding and show yourself!!Åh
491:ShinkÅgShit...!Åh
492:This isn't the time for a nice chat. I've got to figure something out...!
493:ÅHÅHÅHÅg...pervert? Is that true?Åh
494:ShinkÅgN-no... I have an explanation for that too!Åh
495:ÅHÅHÅHÅgHmmm, all right. You can stay in my room for awhile then.Åh
496:ShinkÅgReally!?Åh
497:ÅHÅHÅHÅgSure. In return, let's talk while you wait.Åh
498:ShinkÅgAaah! Is that all?!Åh
499:I'm saved! What a nice girl... And I even get to have a normal conversation with her!
500:ShireneÅgArgh... This is Rin's room?Åh
501:ShinkÅgGah!Åh
502:RinÅgGo hide in the corner. She won't be able to see you from outside.Åh
503:ShinkÅgAaah, sorry!Åh
504:I crawl over to the corner the girl pointed at.
505:Indeed, it doesn't look like I can be seen from the window there.
506:ShireneÅgRin! Did you see a pervert?Åh
507:RinÅgA pervert? No, I did not.Åh
508:ShireneÅgOh... nevermind then.Åh
509:RinÅgSure. Don't do anything reckless, Shirene.Åh
510:ShireneÅgI'm not being reckless! Sorry for bothering you.Åh
511:RinÅgWhew, you're safe now. It looks like she left.Åh
512:ShinkÅgAaaah, you saved me. I can't thank you enough.Åh
513:RinÅgIt's fine. Oh, I'm Rin.Åh
514:ShinkÅgShink. I'm the new teacher here at the academy.Åh
515:The girl gives me her name with a smile. In response, I thank her and introduce myself.
516:That small act calms me down for some reason, and the fatigue I had built up suddenly disappears.
517:ShinkÅgSigh. How am I going to fix this misunderstanding...Åh
518:RinÅgI think it'll work itself out. Considering the amount of commotion, Dr. Kyute will probably come investigate.Åh
FIXME Kyute's title again.
519:RinÅgI think even Shirene should calm down then.Åh
520:ShinkÅgReally? In that case, all I can do is hope...Åh
521:In other words, I'm stuck hiding in Rin's room for the time being.
522:Well, I thought I was going to die today so in comparison, this is no big deal.
523:RinÅgUntil then, is it all right if I talk with you?Åh
524:ShinkÅgSure. I don't have anything else to do. What do you want to talk about?Åh
525:RinÅgAh, let's start with...Åh
526:Having escaped after being chased around, my body finally returns to normal. I pass the time chatting with Rin for awhile.
527:RinÅgWow. So that's what it's like to live as a human.Åh
528:ShinkÅgIs the life of a monster really that different?Åh
529:RinÅgDefinitely. There are some similarities, but lots of differences too.Åh
530:ShinkÅgHmmm. Around here, it could get me in trouble if I don't understand those differences...Åh
531:During our talk, I begin to clearly understand the differences between humans and monsters.
532:As I suspected, it'll be absolutely necessary to know these things in order to get along with them.
533:ShinkÅgThanks so much. I'm really glad we got to talk.Åh
534:RinÅgMe too. Being able to talk with you was a lot of fun.Åh
535:ShinkÅgStill, I'm sorry to have bothered you while you were relaxing.Åh
536:RinÅgAh, my body is rather frail. I spend most of my time like this anyway.Åh
537:RinÅgSo there's no need to feel bad about it.Åh
538:ShinkÅgYour body is frail? You're a dragon though, aren't you?Åh
539:I believe I've heard that dragons are a very hardy species.
540:RinÅgYes, but I've been weak ever since I was born. It's unusual, I know.Åh
541:ShinkÅgAah, well everyone is different. There are weak humans and strong humans too.Åh
542:Sensing that there may be some complicated circumstances behind it, I offer a few words of consolation.
May be hinting at something in Rin's past that Shink feels guilty for prodding at?
543:However, I'm terrible at this kind of thing so I don't think I helped very much.
544:RinÅgHehe, thank you.Åh
545:Nevertheless, Rin flashes me a warm smile as though she understood my intent.
546:Feeling a sense of relief, I stand up to leave.
547:RinÅgAh, going back to your room now?Åh
548:ShinkÅgYeah. I can't stay here forever, after all.Åh
Some of these Shink "aaah's" should probably be "Yeah" or "Uh huh" instead.
549:Besides, things have probably calmed down out there by now.
550:I suppose I'll be able to survive on my own.
551:RinÅgI'll take a look down the hall for you first.Åh
552:ShinkÅgThanks.Åh
553:RinÅgIt's nothing. It's the least I can do for taking so much of your time talking... Ooooh!Åh
554:ShinkÅg...? What's wrong?Åh
555:Rin gets up off her futon and walks over to the door. Suddenly, she stops and begins to grimace.
556:What's going on... Is she going to sneeze?
557:RinÅgOooh, ngh... Can't hold it... Run, ngh...!Åh
558:ShinkÅgHuh...? I don't think I need to run or anything from just a sneeze...Åh
559:RinÅgThat's not tru... Ngh, oooh!Åh
560:RinÅgAchooo!!Åh
561:ShinkÅgGyaaaaa!?Åh
562:What the hell!? H-hot!? What in the...!?
563:ShinkÅgS-something's burning...! I, I'm on fire!!Åh
564:RinÅgAaah! I'm so sorry! The fire extinguisher! We need the fire extinguisher!Åh
565:RinÅg...achooo!!Åh
566:ShinkÅgWhaaaaaa!?Åh
567:Why is she blowing more flames while talking about a fire extinguisher!
568:Shit! I'm going to die at this rate! I'm really going to die!!
569:RinÅgKyaaaa! Someone, someone help!!Åh
570:ShinkÅgAnd do it quickly!!Åh
571:ShinkÅgHaaa, haaa... I thought I was a goner...Åh
572:KyuteÅgSeriously... You're lucky I noticed the commotion.Åh
573:RinÅgS-sorry.Åh
574:Hearing all the noise that Rin and I were making, Kyute showed up and put out the fire.
575:I shudder to think what could have happened if she had come a little later.
576:ShinkÅgSo... That fire just now... That was you, Rin?Åh
577:RinÅgY-yes. When I sneeze, fire shoots out...Åh
578:ShinkÅgWow, really?Åh
More like "what's up with that?"
579:I've never heard of that before. Does that happen with all dragons?
580:RinÅgWell... It's kind of like my body's so weak that I can't control my own abilities...Åh
581:KyuteÅgThey're just too strong for her. However, she should be fine with a bit more practice.Åh
582:ShinkÅgI, I see...Åh
583:That sounds like quite an annoyance too...
584:But what could she have done? She already thinks she's at fault for her condition. Blaming her would just be mean.
585:ShinkÅgI'm not seriously hurt so don't worry about it. Only my clothes...Åh
586:ShireneÅgRin! What was all that noise just now...!!Åh
587:ShinkÅgGah...!?Åh
588:Such bad timing again! Why do things keep getting even more complicated!!
589:ShireneÅgYOOOOOOUUUUUUU!!Åh
590:RinÅgWait, Shirene! It isn't what you think!Åh
591:ShinkÅgSettle down a moment, please!Åh
592:ShireneÅgYou're standing in Rin's room naked! What is there to misunderstand?! I'll deal with you!!Åh
593:ShinkÅgHold up!?Åh
594:Shit, she didn't even give me time to explain myself! Kyute's even here...!
595:KyuteÅgOh my. I thought it was just Rin, but I see you've already made friends with Shirene too.Åh
596:ShinkÅgWhat makes it look like we're friends!!Åh
597:ShireneÅgQuit jabbering! Drop dead, pervert...!!Åh
Get blown away! or something like that
598:Not good... It doesn't look like she's going to back down.
599:The horse girl quickly spins around, plants her front legs firmly on the ground... and delivers a kick directly at my body.
600:ShinkÅgGohuaaaa!!Åh
601:ShireneÅgHeh, there goes the devil.Åh
602:The horse girl's powerful kick scores a direct hit, sending me high into the air.
603:ShinkÅgShiiiiiit! Why am I the only one that keeps having to suffer!!Åh
604:ShireneÅgDon't worry. I won't kill you.Åh
605:ShinkÅgThat's not the issue!!Åh
606:The horse girl flashes me a triumphant smile and yells after me as I fly out of the room.
607:KyuteÅgAnd so this is Professor Shink Celestite. He'll be teaching at the academy starting this year.Åh
608:ShinkÅg...happy to be here.Åh
609:In the end, Kyute introduced the students to me and cleared up any misunderstandings. I'm still completely exhausted from earlier though.
610:After her explanation, the girls stare doubtfully, as if they already have a bad impression of me.
611:RinÅgOnce again, I'm Rin Drave. Pleased to meet you, Professor Shink.Åh
612:ShinkÅgAh, yeah... thanks.Åh
613:As might be expected, Rin doesn't appear to have a negative impression of me.
614:Although it's hard to say that sounded like she had a positive impression either.
615:Well, I suppose it's impossible to expect to make friends with them right when we first meet.
616:I'd like to think it'll all work out in time, but who knows.
617:For now, I'll just have to be careful around sneezes.
618:CometÅgComet Meteor. So you're a teacher. Considering all the commotion earlier, you must be fairly new at this.Åh
What a name.
619:ShinkÅgYeah. Nice to meet you. Sorry about earlier.Åh
620:CometÅgIt was nothing. Just go without food for a full week.Åh
621:ShinkÅg...are you going to hold a grudge over that?Åh
622:CometÅgNot really. It was a joke. You have no sense of humor. You should fix that.Åh
623:ShinkÅgIs that so...Åh
624:I think the problem is that it's hard to tell when she's joking, not that my sense of humor is lacking.
625:Given her indifferent tone of voice and hard to read expression, I don't know what she thinks about me.
626:She isn't treating me with hostility, but I don't feel she's particularly fond of me either.
627:BibiÅgBibi Quin Anaphylaxis. Allow me to thank you for entertaining me so soon after your arrival.Åh
Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. Common causes include insect bites/stings...
628:ShinkÅgI wasn't trying to entertain you or anything. Some percentage of that was your doing too, you know.Åh
629:BibiÅgDon't sweat the details. I'm just glad I had fun.Åh
630:ShinkÅgI see...Åh
631:I think I understand her somehow. She's a natural born troublemaker.
632:The type that doesn't give a damn what happens as a result of her fun. Very bothersome.
633:ShinkÅgAnd lastly... Errr...Åh
634:ShireneÅgShirene Centoru. A member of the proud centaur race.Åh
Her last name is English centaur (Japanified). Her species/race name is the German word for centaur. Probably have to change one or the other or both.
635:ShinkÅgIs, is that so... Well, I look forward to being your teacher.Åh
636:ShireneÅgI don't intend to greet you. I hate perverts like you more than anything.Åh
637:ShireneÅgPlus you're a human. I can't find any reason to wish you well.Åh
638:ShinkÅgUngh...Åh
639:ShireneÅgGet it? You may be a teacher, but I don't give a damn what you do. Just don't get on my nerves.Åh
640:ShinkÅgHey now...Åh
641:After saying her piece, Shirene rushes out of the dining hall.
642:Her one-sided monologue left me no opportunity to interject. I simply stood there dumbfounded.
643:ShinkÅg...ooookay.Åh
644:Things aren't looking so hot...
645:RinÅgProfessor Shink, please don't get discouraged. Even Shirene will come around eventually.Åh
646:ShinkÅgThat'd certainly be nice.Åh
647:CometÅgSince introductions are over, may I be excused? I have things to do.Åh
648:BibiÅgI must be going too. Just look at the time. I'm already sleepy.Åh
649:Without waiting for a reply, Comet and Bibi take their leave.
650:All of them certainly have some bad habits.
651:KyuteÅgSigh... Honestly, they're so inconsiderate.Åh
652:RinÅgUhh, Dr. Kyute, I need to be...Åh
653:KyuteÅgAh, sorry. Keep yourself warm out there.Åh
'Don't let your body cool off' sounds kind of weird. I've never heard the expression so I assume it has something to do with her being a dragon. Maybe some kind of foreshadowing?
654:RinÅgI will. Please excuse me.Åh
655:Even Rin returns to her room with nothing more than exchanging greetings.
656:The greeting was better than nothing, but I still feel there's a wall between us.
657:Well, I didn't expect to be able to make friends with them right off the bat so I guess this is fine...
658:ShinkÅgSo Kyute... Are all of them...Åh
659:KyuteÅgYes, they're all in your class.Åh
660:ShinkÅgI figured...Åh
661:KyuteÅgThey're not here right now, but there are a few more problem students in your class too. Please bear with them.Åh
662:ShinkÅgSeriously?Åh
663:I thought I was going to have enough trouble with just these girls, but there are more?
664:This really is going to be a challenge...
665:ShinkÅgHaaa. Well, I better turn in for the night. I'm worn out after all that.Åh
666:KyuteÅgAll right. Good night.Åh
667:Kyute waves goodbye with a wry smile as I leave the dining hall.
668:ShinkÅgHaaa... The future's looking grim, isn't it...Åh
669:I returned to my room after the customary introductions were over, but unable to sleep, I came out here to gaze at the moon alone.
670:I'm supposed to teach human history to a bunch of monsters.
671:I think that's important and worth doing.
672:However, the students are a problem.
673:ShinkÅgMaybe none of them have any interest in humans...Åh
674:That seems clear from the little I've talked to them.
675:They care for me about as much as any of the rocks around here.
676:Even Rin, who sat and listened to me talk, didn't give me the impression that she was interested.
677:ShinkÅgOther than the half-human Kyute, am I really going to make friends with them...?Åh
678:ÅHÅHÅHÅgOh, already despondent? Are you going to quit and return to human society?Åh
679:ShinkÅgIs that you Pham?Åh
680:PhamÅgIndeed. You've become quite depressed since we met so long ago last night.Åh
Hard to translate. It sounds like she's making fun of how little time has passed by exaggerating it and then contrasting it to his quick change in attitude. Actually this whole conversation makes my head hurt.
681:ShinkÅgYeah, I guess.Åh
682:I can't give any more than a half-hearted reply to her somewhat sarcastic ribbing.
683:Where did my initial determination go... This is pathetic.
684:PhamÅgHmmm, you look very troubled. Are we really that different?Åh
685:ShinkÅgYes, very different. It's hard to explain, but there's probably some difference at a fundamental level.Åh
686:PhamÅgHmmm. But is it really a difference between humans and monsters, I wonder?Åh
687:ShinkÅg...? What do you mean...Åh
688:Isn't it obvious? There are things that just can't be understood between humans and monsters.
689:For example, a human would never have blown me off at our first meeting...
690:PhamÅgI wonder if that's really different.Åh
691:ShinkÅgEh...?Åh
692:PhamÅgThere are apathetic people who are indifferent towards others. Human or monster, that doesn't change.Åh
693:PhamÅgHow do you become friends and get to know them? That has nothing to do with a difference in species.Åh
694:ShinkÅgThat's...Åh
695:I see. Pham's right.
696:I can't expect anybody to have an interest in a stranger that had nothing to do with them until now.
697:I need to take action, learn, get to know them, and then finally understand.
698:Their species has nothing to do with it
699:ShinkÅgDamn. I can't believe I forgot something so obvious. I'm an idiot.Åh
700:PhamÅgHehe, I'm glad to see you've regained your motivation.Åh
701:ShinkÅgYeah. My uneasiness hasn't disappeared, but I'm going to give it a try.Åh
702:PhamÅgThat's good to hear. I have high hopes for you... Good luck.Åh
703:ShinkÅgAh, hey.Åh
704:Leaving me with those words, Pham disappears like smoke in the wind.
705:What a mysterious girl. She talks like she knows everything and then vanishes.
706:ShinkÅgI guess there's no point worrying about that either.Åh
707:Besides, she keeps giving me encouragement.
708:I'll have to thank her properly next time.
709:ÉVShinkÅgAll right! Let's do this!Åh
710:I don't know how much I can manage, but it's no use if I don't try.
711:First, I need to get on good terms with the students and go from there.
712:I fire myself up looking at the moon then slowly walk back to my room.
713:ShinkÅgThus, in that year...Åh
714:Student 1ÅgDamn, my parents back home are so stubborn.Åh
715:Student 2ÅgI know, I know! Like, mine are the worst. I just want them to leave me alone.Åh
716:ShinkÅgUmmmm, hey... Over there...Åh
717:With spring break over, the new school year has finally begun.
718:I tried to start with a rather easy to understand lesson, but I'm having a difficult time with the class...
719:ShinkÅgThis is hardly going well...Åh
720:When I look around the classroom, the majority of students are occupied chatting or sleeping.
721:Even worse, it appears a third of them didn't even come to class at all.
722:They're probably skipping. Of the ones I already know, I don't see Rin, Bibi, or Comet in attendance.
723:Shirene is here, but...
724:ShireneÅg...hmph.Åh
725:She gives me a displeased stare when I simply look her way. That's not much better than being absent.
726:The other students aren't paying attention to me either. Should I have started with getting to know them first?
727:Maybe it was a mistake to try giving an actual lecture on the first day of school.
728:Do I need to rework my lesson plans?
729:ShinkÅgOh, is class time over already? Well then...Åh
730:Student 1ÅgYay! Let's go have some fun!Åh
731:Student 2ÅgNot so fast, girl. We have Professor Kyute's class next, right?Åh
732:Student 3ÅgYep. We can't cut class.Åh
I'm terrible at writing female dialogue. Feel free to re-style or fluff these generic student lines since none of them are voiced anyway.
733:ShinkÅg...sigh.Åh
734:Can they not even say goodbye properly to me at the end of class? Is being human really enough of a reason to treat me with contempt?
735:I guess this was inevitable at the start. Anyway, I want to raise my image so I can teach lessons normally. 
736:With thoughts like those swimming through my head, I step out of the boisterous classroom.
737:ShinkÅgHmmm, what should I do first...Åh
738:Having no experience with this, I don't even know where to begin.
739:Demanding that they listen to me... probably not going to work.
740:Threatening them with failure and telling them they won't graduate likely won't be effective either.
741:My class is already full of students repeating a year so I'll have to think of another way to get them interested in school.
742:At any rate, this is going to take some time. What a headache.
743:ShinkÅgThis is tough. Really tough.Åh
744:ÅHÅHÅHÅgHii, hiaaaaaa!!Åh
745:ShinkÅgWh-what the...!?Åh
746:While racking my brains for solutions, I hear an out-of-place scream from somewhere.
747:It sounded like it came from above, but that wasn't Pham.
748:ShinkÅg...who in the world...?Åh
749:ÅHÅHÅHÅgUwaaa! No! Please don't look! But help meeeee!!Åh
750:ShinkÅg...oh man.Åh
751:I dare to look up with a twinge of anxiety. There, I see a panicked young girl with her tail coiled around a tree branch.
752:She's flailing around desperately while keeping her skirt in place with her hands.
753:ShinkÅgHey, this isn't the time to calmly note the situation!Åh
754:ÅHÅHÅHÅgHunununu... HUR-RY-UP! I can't hold on much longer!Åh
755:ShinkÅgUmm, hold on. Gimme a second...Åh
756:How can I help her? There probably isn't time to go get a ladder... So climb the tree, I guess?
757:ShinkÅgAll right! I don't have time to waste thinking it over! Anyway, up the tree...Åh
758:ÅHÅHÅHÅgEeeek!? S-stop! I just heard it creaking!Åh
759:ShinkÅgWhaaa!? Then I'll get a ladder instead!Åh
760:ÅHÅHÅHÅgEeek!? Too late for that! The creaking is getting louder!!Åh
761:ShinkÅgHold, hold on! Hang in there a bit longer!Åh
762:If she falls from there, she's not going to escape injury!
763:ÅHÅHÅHÅgToo late... kyaaaa!!Åh
764:ShinkÅgHo-aaah!Åh
765:Without even time to think, I put myself between the young girl and the ground right as the branch breaks.
766:ShinkÅgOooofff!!Åh
767:ÅHÅHÅHÅgWh... whaaa!? Are you all right!?Åh
768:ShinkÅgI'm... not... all right...Åh
769:I managed to catch the girl somehow but she was a lot heavier than I expected!
770:Air rushes out of my lungs, and I nearly faint from the pain.
771:ÅHÅHÅHÅgHey, hang in there! Stay with me!Åh
772:ShinkÅgBring... bring me to Dr. Kyute...Åh
773:ÅHÅHÅHÅgUwawa! Got it!Åh
774:It's pretty pathetic that I ended up being carried by the girl I saved.
775:Why did this happen to me...
776:KyuteÅgHonestly. How did you manage to get hurt this badly on the first day of classes...Åh
777:ShinkÅgI'm ashamed of myself too... Ow ow ow!Åh
778:In somewhat appalling condition, I bow my head and try to endure the pain as Kyute sees to my wounds.
779:That antiseptic cream she's using really hurts.
780:KyuteÅgSo you were injured because of Mirita?Åh
781:MiritaÅgAuuu... I'm sorry, Kyute.Åh
782:KyuteÅgDon't apologize to me. Moreover, haven't I told you to call me 'professor' when on campus?Åh
783:MiritaÅgOooh... I'm sincerely sorry for messing up... And sorry to you, too.Åh
784:ShinkÅgIt's fine, I wasn't hurt that badly, after all. I'm just glad you're safe.Åh
785:It'd honestly be embarrassing if she felt indebted to me over something so minor.
786:There's nothing better than being able to help other people.
787:MiritaÅg...th-thank you very much.Åh
788:ShinkÅgIt was nothing. By the way, you look like a student, but...Åh
789:MiritaÅgAh, I am. Mirita H. Askrepio.Åh
She pronounces her full middle name, but the Japanese text just has H in English for it.
790:ShinkÅgOh...? Where have I seen that name before...Åh
791:Askrepio... Askrepio... Hmmm.
792:ShinkÅgOh, that's right. You're in my class, aren't you? Although I didn't see you in attendance today...Åh
793:MiritaÅgHuh...? You're a professor?Åh
794:ShinkÅgYeah, Shink Celestite. I'm here to teach human history. I'm also in charge of your class.Åh
Homeroom teacher thing again.
795:MiritaÅgOh, is that so?Åh
796:KyuteÅgMirita. Am I hearing what I think I am?Åh
797:MiritaÅgHiuu!?Åh
798:KyuteÅgYou didn't show up to class? Were you cutting, perhaps?Åh
799:MiritaÅgN-no! I'd never dream of cutting class...!Åh
800:KyuteÅgBut you weren't there, were you? I've told you before, but skipping your lectures is...Åh
801:ShinkÅg.........Åh
802:Wow. Kyute's demeanor has definitely become scary... Did something provoke her wrath?
803:I don't think she was skipping for no reason, but it doesn't seem like Kyute is going to ask what those reasons were.
804:I guess I have to come to her rescue again.
805:ShinkÅgHey Kyute, she probably wasn't skipping with any bad intent. Calm down, calm down.Åh
Bad intent? Maliciousness? Can't think of any good words for à´ãC here
806:KyuteÅgOh, I see. First of all then, let's hear why you weren't in class.Åh
807:MiritaÅgAuuu, w-well...Åh
808:Mirita curls up like she's withering away under Kyute's glare.
809:Her face is turning red as if there's something embarrassing she wasn't want to say.
810:MiritaÅgWell, you see... Up in this tree, there was... a kitten.Åh
811:ShinkÅgGotcha, I get it.Åh
812:MiritaÅgEh? You already understand?Åh
813:ShinkÅgYeah. You climbed up the tree to help, but then couldn't get back down.Åh
814:MiritaÅgUgh... That's right.Åh
815:KyuteÅgThen the kitten climbed down on its own?Åh
816:MiritaÅgAuuu... I'm so embarrassed.Åh
817:What a cliched turn of events.
818:Just from the little I've heard, I think this girl might be the naturally unlucky type.
819:ShinkÅgWell, there's not much you could have done there, and you probably won't be missing any more classes.Åh
820:MiritaÅgOf course not! There's no way I'll cut class or anything!Åh
821:ShinkÅgI'm happy just to hear that.Åh
822:If only I could get all the other students to simply come to class like this...
823:KyuteÅgI think the next class is about to start. Mirita, you may be excused.Åh
824:MiritaÅgAll right. Umm... I'm looking forward to being in your class, professor.Åh
825:ShinkÅgThanks. See you in homeroom.Åh
826:MiritaÅgOkay. Goodbye.Åh
827:Mirita bows her head once and exits the room.
828:Similar to Rin, she seemed like a decent, normal girl. She also didn't appear to have any aversion to humans.
829:ShinkÅgBy the way, you and Mirita know one another, right? You two seemed very close.Åh
830:KyuteÅgThat's right. We met a long time ago. Our parents were acquaintances, and she's half-human like me.Åh
831:ShinkÅgOh, is that right?Åh
832:It's no wonder I didn't feel any wall between us because of being human.
833:But I wonder if that isolates her from the rest of her classmates?
834:KyuteÅgShe's reasonably level-headed so she should be fine. Although she doesn't always mind her own business.Åh
"Fairly reliable" etc. Although she has an "overly meddlesome part too"
835:ShinkÅgI see. I'll keep that in mind.Åh
836:In that case, I shouldn't have to worry about her.
837:Or maybe should I say I have plenty of other things to worry about more.
838:ShinkÅgSigh...Åh
839:KyuteÅgWhat's wrong? Is something troubling you?Åh
840:ShinkÅgMmm, yeah. My lesson didn't go well, lots of students skipped class...Åh
841:KyuteÅgSome students skipped? Bibi and Comet, I presume?Åh
842:ShinkÅgThat's right. A few others here and there too... Ah, that reminds me, Rin didn't come either.Åh
843:In Rin's case at least, she probably wasn't skipping.
844:I imagine it had something to do with her weak constitution.
845:KyuteÅgAh, Rin was out sick. She'll be absent on account of her illness more often than not.Åh
846:ShinkÅgI see... Is that so...Åh
847:I already knew from checking the class register that Rin is at the head of the list for repeating grades.
848:Bibi and Comet are there too, but that's simply from missing too many days due to cutting class.
849:ShinkÅgIs she not going to get over her illness?Åh
850:KyuteÅgPerhaps not. The nature of her illness isn't being disclosed, but a complete recovery will be difficult.Åh
851:ShinkÅgI see... If that's the case, I hope she considers the issue of credits and required attendance days.Åh
"Consider" has no subject so I'm guessing here.
852:KyuteÅgThat's a problem too... It doesn't look like any of the other teachers want anything to do with such a problematic child...Åh
853:ShinkÅg.........Åh
854:That's terrible. What kind of teachers are they...
855:Be that as it may, it's not like there's anything I can do about her situation either.
856:KyuteÅgUmm, I have to get to class soon too...Åh
857:ShinkÅgAh, yeah, sorry. Thanks a lot for fixing me up.Åh
858:KyuteÅgIt was nothing. I'm going to close up the room so shall we leave together?Åh
859:ShinkÅgThat's fine. I better go prepare my next lesson anyway.Åh
860:We stand up and exit the room as a pair.
861:My lectures, my students... I've got lots to think about.
862:ShinkÅgHmm...Åh
863:However, when I carefully consider the possibilities, I'm not sure where to start.
I hate that sentence.
864:Get on good terms with everyone? Reconsider my lesson plans?
865:ShinkÅgSomething else entirely? This sucks. The more I have to do, the harder it is figure out the best course of action.Åh
That one too.
866:PhamÅgIn such times, you should take care of the most important matters first.Åh
867:ShinkÅgOnce again, you abruptly appear.Åh
868:PhamÅgI sensed that you were troubled. I'm such a good girl, aren't I? Have you fallen for me?Åh
869:ShinkÅgYeah, yeah. Head over heels.Åh
870:PhamÅgAww, such a cold reply. I went to a lot of trouble to come give you advice, too.Åh
Cold reply sucks. Unfriendly/indifferent/unkind response/answer?
871:ShinkÅgAdvice?Åh
872:Pham laughs half-jokingly as I take a long hard look at her face.
873:She has certainly been reliable at giving me encouragement, but...
874:ShinkÅgThis isn't the kind of problem that can be solved with just advice. I have to do something myself about it.Åh
875:PhamÅgI understand that. I'm here to point you down the right path, aren't I?Åh
876:ShinkÅgHmm...Åh
877:As usual, I'm not quite sure what she means.
878:PhamÅgLet's see... Other things are important too, but Rin Dorave... Focus your priorities on her.Åh
879:ShinkÅgHuh? On Rin?Åh
880:For a moment, I'm shocked by Pham's advice.
881:I had already decided that there wasn't anything I could do about her illness so I thought it'd be best to save her for last.
882:PhamÅgI'm not telling you to do something about her illness. Merely, don't use it as a reason to neglect her.Åh
Quit deciding to postpone for that reason
883:ShinkÅgWhy's that?Åh
884:PhamÅgHmm, I wonder? That's something for you to consider. Open yourself to all solutions, don't limit yourself.Åh
Translating someone who speaks mysteriously is a pain.
885:ShinkÅgWell, I suppose, if you say so.Åh
886:PhamÅgThere's no need to think so hard about it. Simply keep her in mind.Åh
Simply pay attention to her
887:PhamÅgThat will end up being your first step.Åh
That will turn out to be connected to your first step, that is supposed to be related to your first step, that will lead to...
888:ShinkÅgMy first step...?Åh
889:So she's saying Rin is the key to improving my relations with the other students?
890:No, that can't be right. She can hardly even attend class because of her illness.
891:Worrying about someone in her condition is natural, but it wouldn't be good to stick my nose where it doesn't belong.
"Meddle too much"
892:That's exactly what's weighing on my mind... Oh well, I guess it doesn't matter.
I don't care, I don't mind
893:PhamÅgHuhu, work hard. Goodbye, until we meet again.Åh
894:ShinkÅgHey, wait!Åh
895:As if sensing that I had arrived at my decision, Pham once again disappears.
896:As usual, I don't what she has in mind, but I feel she isn't a bad person.
Don't know what she's thinking/intending. I understand she isn't a bad guy.
897:I suppose that's good enough for now.
898:ShinkÅgWell then, let's go see how Rin's doing.Åh
899:Feeling like a bit of weight has been lifted off my shoulders, I leisurely walk towards Rin's room.
My mind became lighter, only a bit
900:ShinkÅgRiiin. May I come in?Åh
He totally opened the door before calling out for her. Shirene is right!
901:RinÅgAh, Professor Shink. Yes, please come in.Åh
902:Thinking to strike while the iron's hot, I came to Rin's room without delay.
903:I planned to come back later if she wasn't feeling well, but she looks all right.
904:ShinkÅgHow are you feeling? Oh, here's your dinner.Åh
So much for going straight to her room, right?
905:RinÅgThank you very much. I'm feeling a bit sluggish, but otherwise not bad.Åh
906:ShinkÅgReally? Your face looks kinda red...Åh
907:As Rin speaks, I press my fingers up against the forehead of her smiling face.
While listening to the words of Rin, slightly smiling, I push my hand against her forehead.
908:Although I don't know what a monster's normal body temperature should be, I feel like she's running a bit hot.
909:RinÅgUmm... Professor Shink?Åh
910:ShinkÅgYeah, as I thought, it feels like you have a slight fever. Is that normal for you?Åh
911:RinÅgWe-well... My temperature is always rather high, so this is...Åh
912:ShinkÅgIs that so...Åh
913:I guess I have to take her word for it, but I wonder.
914:It's hard to rely on sick people themselves, after all. I wonder if it's written in a book somewhere.
915:RinÅgThat aside... You're a bit close to me, professor.Åh
916:ShinkÅgHuh...? Oh, uwaa! S-sorry!Åh
917:RinÅgIt, it's okay...Åh
918:After Rin calls attention to the situation, I hastily withdraw my hand and put some distance between us.
919:Although I was worried about her, I definitely went too far.
920:Somehow her face has become even redder than before... Crap.
921:ShinkÅgSo, come to think of it, there weren't many students in class today. Is it always like that?Åh
922:In order to change the subject, I try asking her about today's class.
923:However, I do wonder, just for a moment, about the vague, embarrassed smile she gave me.
924:What? Did I say something strange?
925:RinÅgUmmm, I'm absent a lot because of my illness so I don't really know that well...Åh
926:ShinkÅgAh...Åh
927:Dammit! That's right. What kind of idiot would ask her that!
928:Knowing she can't attend most of her classes because of her weak constitution, I went and asked that anyway. Could I read the situation any worse?
Bleh. Probably too long. FIXME
929:RinÅgBut when I do go, about 30% of the class isn't there.Åh
930:ShinkÅgOh, I see. Sorry for the strange question.Åh
931:RinÅgI don't really mind. It's only natural for you to worry.Åh
932:After answering with a strained smile, Rin begins to eat the food I brought her.
933:While watching that, I let out a sigh silently to myself.
So that it is not noticed (by her)
934:RinÅgMmm, the food the ladies in the dining hall make is always delicious.Åh
935:ShinkÅgAh, yeah. It definitely is.Åh
936:RinÅgIs something wrong? It's hard to eat with someone looking at me like that.Åh
937:ShinkÅgOh, sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt... crap.Åh
938:Yeah, I probably couldn't eat while being stared at either.
939:Sigh. I haven't made any progress at all, but maybe I should just go...
940:ShinkÅgWell then, I'll be...Åh
941:CometÅgRin. Your medicine... Oh?Åh
942:ShinkÅgComet?Åh
943:Just as I stood up to leave, the door opened and Comet entered.
944:Is that medicine she's carrying?
945:RinÅgAh, Comet. As always, thanks.Åh
946:CometÅgNo, it's no problem, but why is the professor here...Åh
947:ShinkÅgErr, I was just...Åh
948:She's looking at me with suspicion, but I guess it does look bad for me to be in a student's room at this hour.
949:CometÅgOh, I get it. A late-night booty call. Oh no, we can't make the teacher himself sit in the corner.Åh
I think she's referring to punishing him the way a teacher would make a student sit in a corner.
950:ÉVShinkÅgBooty what!?Åh
951:What is she talking about!?
952:CometÅgI can't believe it. I thought you were an upstanding teacher in class, but now I must amend my judgment.Åh
953:ShinkÅgIdiot! Besides, it's barely evening! And you weren't in class in the first place!Åh
954:CometÅgOh, so you noticed. Are you a stalker?Åh
955:ShinkÅgI'm your teacher!Åh
956:As usual, she says the most outrageous things!
957:ShinkÅgRin... Rin, say something!Åh
958:RinÅgProfessor Shink, were you...Åh
959:ShinkÅgWhaaaaaaaat!?Åh
960:What's with that look!? She believes Comet over me!?
961:CometÅgOoh, you look pitiful, professor.Åh
962:ShinkÅgWhy do I feel a crushing sense of defeat...Åh
963:CometÅgCome now, you can't expect her to believe a human fresh from the country. You give up, yeah?Åh
Japanese idiom, probably replace with something that sounds better.
964:ShinkÅgLike hell! And why are you speaking like that anyway!?Åh
965:This isn't right! Why is she talking to me like she would her friends. I'm her teacher!
Japanese formality stuff. She isn't using polite or honorific speech to a teacher like she should.
966:ShinkÅgAnyway! Don't make fun of your elders!Åh
967:CometÅgI was being serious.Åh
968:ShinkÅgYou wicked, nasty...!Åh
969:RinÅgHehe, you two sure are getting along great.Åh
970:ShinkÅgEhhh...Åh
971:Getting along... great? No matter how you look at it, I think this is going poorly.
Bleh.
972:CometÅgAre you jealous? Scary, scary.Åh
973:RinÅgHuh? Jealous? Why?Åh
974:ShinkÅg.........Åh
975:CometÅg...never mind.Åh
She says "don't mind" in Engrish.
976:ShinkÅgShut up.Åh
977:Now I understand. I understand, but it's a shock to hear it so plainly.
978:Well, it looked like she really wasn't interested in humans, but I guess that confirms it.
979:ShinkÅgSigh, that's enough. I'll be going now.Åh
980:RinÅgAll right. Thanks for the meal.Åh
981:ShinkÅgGet some rest and don't strain yourself. Take care of her Comet.Åh
982:CometÅgOoh, what an admirable request. My impression of you rises.Åh
983:ShinkÅgWhatever.Åh
984:CometÅgTch, crabby old man.Åh
What's an insulting word for teacher in English? Professor Douchebag or something
985:Did I hear that right...
986:Well, who cares. The path ahead of me is already a minefield of problems.
Bleh.
987:ShinkÅgAs I thought, there's a wall between us.Åh
He just says "there's a wall." in Japanese.
988:I thought so during our conversations earlier, but I feel there's a wall even between me and the comparatively friendly Rin.
989:Or rather, between her and humanity, perhaps?
990:She's acting nicely to me for the time being because I'm her teacher, but I don't think we're becoming friends or anything.
991:Maybe that's just how it is for humans and monsters.
992:ShinkÅgIt's frustrating to be treated with utter indifference.Åh
993:But maybe it's because I haven't interacted with her much so far.
994:If we spend more time together in some way or other, I feel we could get along.
995:I wonder how much more time it'll take though.
996:ShinkÅgAll right. I've gotta stick with it.Åh
997:Seeing what I have to do has made my hesitation fade a bit.
998:My decision is made, now I just have to carry it out.
999:ShinkÅgOkay, for today's class, how about we change gears and play a game?Åh
1000:As soon as class starts, I propose my newly-concocted plan.
1001:If I taught normally again, not only would they not enjoy it, but they probably wouldn't learn anything either.
1002:Besides, spring break has just ended and the students still aren't back into the swing of things.
Haven't yet come out of vacation mood.
1003:It's only natural that they wouldn't pay serious attention to lectures right now. Even I've felt that way before.
1004:Therefore, I think I might be able to generate some interest by playing a game with them.
1005:It seems like I wasn't mistaken. The boisterous students are all looking at me now.
1006:Student 1ÅgProfessor, does that mean it's fine if we screw around?Åh
1007:ShinkÅgNo, we're not screwing around. Here, take a look at this first.Åh
1008:I post a sheet with a map drawn on it onto the board.
1009:Student 2ÅgHuh? That's the Rucium Plains, isn't it?Åh
Rushiumu
1010:ShinkÅgYes, that's correct. Now it probably isn't important in monster history, but many battles have been fought here among humans.Åh
1011:ShinkÅgDoes anyone know the names of the empire and kingdom who primarily contested the area?Åh
1012:I look around the room, but it doesn't seem like anyone knows.
1013:I suppose it's only natural they don't know since our history hasn't been taught to monsters.
1014:BibiÅgThis is nice and all, but what's the game? I'm only awake because I care about that.Åh
1015:ShinkÅgIf possible, I'd appreciate it if you stayed awake.Åh
1016:BibiÅgIf your lesson is interesting, I'll take that into consideration.Åh
1017:ShinkÅgYeah, yeah.Åh
Half-hearted, insincere agreement
1018:I give Bibi and her pompous attitude a strained laugh and place a marker on the map.
1019:I'm lucky she even came to class today, but it'd be even better if I can create some interest in history with this.
1020:ShinkÅgThink of this marker as a human solider. Now divide into two groups and we'll have a battle simulation.Åh
1021:BibiÅgOoh, a strategy game? I see, that does sound fun.Åh
1022:ShireneÅgHmph, what a waste of time. Something like this isn't nearly as constructive as my own training.Åh
1023:ShinkÅgNo, I'm not trying to teach you military tactics or anything like that.Åh
1024:This is all a plan to teach human history.
1025:In the first place, I'm no military strategist. It'd turn out bad if they're expecting that.
1026:ShinkÅgJust give it a try for now.Åh
1027:Student 1ÅgOkay! All right, I'm not going to lose!Åh
1028:Student 2ÅgMe neither!Åh
1029:It looks like I've got their attention for the time being. The real test is whether they put some effort into this.
1030:BibiÅgHeh, and now victory is mine. You weren't so hard to beat, Shirene.Åh
1031:ShireneÅgNgh, you got lucky! I just made a few mistakes!Åh
Literally more like "I was in bad form just now"
1032:BibiÅgNo way, a few mistakes weren't the issue. You got crushed.Åh
Fixing the bad form isn't the issue
1033:ShireneÅgKuh...!Åh
1034:ShinkÅg......Åh
1035:After a short period of time, it looks like it's over.
1036:Now, the hard part...
1037:ShinkÅgSetting aside the outcome, did anything particular stick out during the game?Åh
1038:Student 1ÅgAnything particular...?Åh
1039:Student 2ÅgYeah, was there something we should have noticed? It was fun and all, but...Åh
1040:ShinkÅgIs that so...Åh
1041:Did it not work after all? It'd be easy to just tell them the answer, although...
1042:BibiÅgIt took longer than I expected. If I had a way to attack from farther away, I could have won even faster.Åh
1043:ShinkÅgYes! That's it!Åh
1044:ShireneÅgHuh? What are you yelling about?Åh
1045:ShinkÅgWhat Bibi just said is exactly what I wanted you to notice.Åh
1046:BibiÅgHmmm? I see, that makes sense.Åh
1047:ShireneÅgHold on, what's he saying to you? Tell me what's going on!Åh
1048:BibiÅgOh my god, you're so thickheaded. If you thought about it for a second, you'd get what this human wants to say.Åh
1049:ShireneÅg...???Åh
1050:Student 1ÅgHey, hey, what is it?Åh
1051:Student 2ÅgI don't know, but if Bibi says so, there must be something!Åh
1052:It seems as though Bibi understands, but none of the other students do.
1053:In that case, Bibi should explain...
1054:CometÅgAll right, it's my turn. Dodonn!Åh
Needs a sound effect onomatopoeia
1055:ShinkÅgWhoa!?Åh
1056:BibiÅgWhat the, you didn't skip class today?Åh
1057:CometÅgI sensed that something interesting was happening, and I always trust my instincts.Åh
Literally, Somehow I felt an interesting-seeming presence/sign. My perception isn't something I threw away.
1058:ShireneÅgSo that means you understand what Bibi realized too?Åh
1059:CometÅgNaturally. Throughout history, humans have advanced entirely as a result of war and depravity.Åh
She uses ë¬óé, which is corruption or depravity. Seems that something like "hardship" would fit the conversation better.
1060:CometÅgWhile devising new ways to effectively wage war, technology progressed. Or they developed technology simply to make their lives easier.Åh
1061:CometÅgHe wants us to learn that if you study history, you'll see that idea in many places.Åh
1062:ShireneÅgWhat's with that? Humans are always so foolish.Åh
1063:ShinkÅgWell, I can't totally deny that.Åh
1064:Nonetheless, that wasn't the whole lesson.
1065:ShinkÅgEven those kinds of negative aspects are necessary for progress.Åh
1066:ShinkÅgAlthough negative aspects aren't the only way technology has progressed.Åh
Of course, it is not the case that we have developed only from negative aspects.
1067:ShinkÅgBut if you know these reasons, you will see history from different points of view. It's very interesting, as you can imagine.Åh
1068:ShinkÅgOf course, this isn't just limited to human history.Åh
1069:ShireneÅgMonster history is like that too?Åh
1070:BibiÅgHaha, there's no way. I think you need to learn how to analyze diverse concepts.Åh
Hell of a sentence "It appears as if you must train how to grasp diverse/multifaceted things."
1071:CometÅgOh my, it appears it was too difficult for the children.Åh
Calls her a youngster, lad, etc.
1072:ShireneÅgYou aren't that much different!Åh
1073:BibiÅgI think we're at least three years older than you.Åh
1074:CometÅgReason: we haven't been at this academy a long time for nothing.Åh
This sentence seems very straight-forward in Japanese, but kind of an odd thing to say. Meant as a joke maybe?
1075:ShireneÅgThat's not something to be proud of!Åh
1076:ShinkÅgCertainly not...Åh
1077:That's only true because they've repeated the same year over and over.
1078:ShinkÅgAnyway, don't take the history you're taught at face value. Consider everything from multiple angles.Åh
1079:As I summarize the lesson, the bell indicating the end of class rings.
1080:Today's class went a hell of a lot better than yesterday's.
1081:I can't very well teach in a game format every day though. I'll have to think of other methods, but this boosted my confidence at least.
1082:ShinkÅgWell then, that's all for today. If there's anything you want to know more about, don't hesitate to ask.Åh
1083:Student 1ÅgOkaaaay.Åh
1084:ShireneÅgHmph. Hey, prepare better for the next lesson.Åh
1085:ShinkÅg......Åh
1086:As you'd expect, Shirene's impression of me is still poor. It's only natural it wouldn't have improved given how the class went.
1087:BibiÅgNo way, today's class was great, professor. Keep up the good work.Åh
1088:ShinkÅgYou look so proud.Åh
1089:CometÅgThat's how she always looks. Well, I don't feel any more interesting things are going to happen today. I suppose I'll go hide.Åh
1090:ShinkÅgCome on, go to your other classes.Åh
1091:CometÅgI must decline.Åh
But I refuse.
1092:ShinkÅgWhy's that...Åh
1093:I don't really understand. It's a problem that she's so stubborn even when a teacher tells her what to do.
What she should do
1094:Is this also something that will need time to solve?
1095:Fortunately there's still plenty of that before graduation. Hopefully I can solve everything before the number of days left is a problem.
1096:ShinkÅgPay attention in your next classes.Åh
1097:Student 1ÅgWork hard yourself, professor.Åh
1098:Student 2ÅgDon't let anyone push you around!Åh
Do not be made fun of / made light of / treated with contempt (all passive)
1099:ShinkÅgÇÕÇ¢ÇÕÇ¢Åh
1100:You girls are the ones pushing me around... I put that out of my mind as I leave the classroom.
1101:ShinkÅgAnd that's how today's class went.Åh
1102:As evening approaches, I head over to Rin's room and fill her in on the contents of today's lesson.
1103:I'm concerned about her falling behind, and more than just that too.
1104:RinÅgWow, you're amazing. It's rare for Bibi and Comet to take a class seriously.Åh
1105:ShinkÅgSeriously?Åh
1106:I figured that was the case from their behavior, but I didn't realize it was that bad.
1107:Modifying my teaching strategy turned out to be a good idea. It was popular among the other students as well.
1108:RinÅgThat's wonderful. Now I want to try attending your class too.Åh
1109:ShinkÅgOh, you'll come out if your condition improves? If that happens, I'll make you come even if you hate it.Åh
Come out = leave (your room)
1110:RinÅgAha, that's possible too.Åh
1111:Rin responds with a lonely smile.
1112:Should I do something to cheer her up?
1113:ShinkÅgSo while I'm here, shall I lecture for a bit?Åh
1114:RinÅgHuh...? Really? You're so busy though...Åh
1115:ShinkÅgDon't worry about me. Besides, I love teaching.Åh
1116:RinÅgA-all right. If you don't mind then...Åh
1117:ShinkÅgHaha, no trouble at all.Åh
1118:I grin back at Rin, who's looking at me with anticipation. I leave for a minute to go get my lesson materials.
1119:RinÅgI see, so people think like that too?Åh
1120:ShinkÅgYeah, although I should mention that's only my personal theory.Åh
1121:Returning with my textbook and other materials, I began Rin's lesson.
1122:While explaining things in a simple manner, I come up with an original thought.
Bleh.
1123:ShinkÅgSince history already occurred long ago, I can't teach you what the people of that time were thinking and feeling.Åh
1124:ShinkÅgBut you can't say you really understand history then. Considering their thoughts is more important than anything else.Åh
1125:ShinkÅgBesides, wouldn't it be more fun to learn about that?Åh
1126:RinÅgWhat the people back then were thinking, huh...Åh
1127:Since it's entirely my own idea, it honestly might not be helpful to think about at all.
1128:But I think it's the interesting part of history, and it's actually fun to consider.
1129:It's for exactly that reason that I stress using your imagination and don't just teach the facts written in the textbook.
1130:RinÅgWow, that's amazing. When I think of it that way, history suddenly seems interesting.Åh
1131:ShinkÅgHaha, I'm glad to hear you say that.Åh
1132:It appears that Rin likes my method.
1133:It sure would be nice if the other students in class agree with it too.
1134:RinÅgSo... ugh *cough*Åh
1135:ShinkÅgHey, are you all right?Åh
1136:RinÅgI'm fine. *cough* I just had to cough a bit, that's all.Åh
1137:ShinkÅgEven so, don't push yourself too hard. Here, lie down.Åh
1138:RinÅgSorry about this.Åh
1139:ShinkÅgNo need to apologize. I'm a teacher and you're my student. This is the least I can do.Åh
1140:ShinkÅgOh yeah, you take medicine, right? Shall I go ask Dr. Kyute for it?Åh
1141:RinÅg*Cough* That's right... Please, if you don't mind.Åh
1142:ShinkÅgGot it. I'll bring back something to eat too.Åh
1143:Taking medicine on an empty stomach usually isn't a good idea, after all.
1144:I guess it'd be a good idea to confirm that with Kyute.
1145:ShinkÅgAll right, I'll be right back.Åh
1146:RinÅgOkay. Thank you so much.Åh
1147:Rin weakly smiles at me. Smiling back, I leave and head over to Kyute's room to get Rin's medicine.
1148:KyuteÅgHere you go. This is Rin's medicine.Åh
1149:ShinkÅgThanks a lot. Any special instructions that go with it?Åh
1150:KyuteÅgHmmm, she should eat something first, that's all.Åh
1151:ShinkÅgI thought so. I'll go give this to Rin then.Åh
1152:KyuteÅgPlease do, and thanks.Åh
1153:ShinkÅgHaha, you can rely on me.Åh
Please leave it up to me.
1154:I stick around just long enough to get the important points from Kyute.
1155:I figured it was important to know if there were any unusual parts to the medicine, but I'm relieved to hear there aren't.
1156:All I have to do now is get some food from the dining hall and head back to Rin.
1157:ShinkÅgI'll off then, thanks.Åh
1158:I make do with a quick goodbye and exit Kyute's room.
1159:ShinkÅgHi, do you have any food particularly suited to someone who's not feeling well?Åh
1160:Dining StaffÅgOh dear, what's wrong, professor? Did you catch a cold?Åh
1161:ShinkÅgOh no, it's nothing like that.Åh
1162:Arriving at the dining hall, I greet one of the ladies to arrange for Rin's dinner.
1163:For some reason, she seems to have taken a liking to me in the few days I've been here, making her my best monster friend.
1164:It's a little sad, but I know she's reliable from the way she talks with me like someone wise and experienced.
Literally, For some reason I feel sad, but because I get the feeling she's a "life coach" (someone much older and more experienced) from the various things she's told me, her reliability is certain.
I guess he's sad because he hasn't made better friends with anyone else than a lunch lady?
1165:Dining StaffÅgAhh, I see. For the little dragon girl? You've got it tough, professor.Åh
1166:ShinkÅgNot at all. I'm a teacher so doing something this small is nothing.Åh
1167:Dining StaffÅgYou're very kind. Okay, I'll make it in a jiffy, wait right there!Åh
1168:She began preparing the food before she even finished talking.
1169:While I wait for it to cook, I sit in a nearby chair and look around.
1170:I suppose it's still early because there aren't many students to be seen, but there are a few here and there.
1171:One is swallowing some kind of meat whole, and another is drinking a red liquid that's probably blood.
1172:The more I observe, the more I realize how different they are from humans.
1173:ShinkÅgHonestly though, what does that matter?Åh
1174:I'm sure there might be a few things that would make me flinch, but if that's all it took to change my attitude, I wouldn't have applied here.
1175:Besides, even though I've only been living here a few days, I've seen that the students aren't evil monsters.
1176:They simply follow different rules of social etiquette. As long as I keep that in mind, it should be easy to get along with them.
1177:ShinkÅgPerhaps, I guess.Åh
1178:MiritaÅgPerhaps what?Åh
1179:ShinkÅgAh, Mirita?Åh
1180:MiritaÅgYep. Good evening, professor.Åh
1181:ShinkÅgEvening. Here for dinner?Åh
1182:MiritaÅgYeah. I tried asking everyone, but ended up coming to eat alone in the end.Åh
1183:Mirita slumps her shoulders. Not knowing what to say to her, I just stay silent.
1184:As though understanding anyway, Mirita flashes me a bit of a smile and sits down on the chair beside me.
1185:MiritaÅgWhat's wrong, professor? That's medicine, isn't it?Åh
1186:ShinkÅgYeah, I thought I'd bring Rin her dinner and medicine.Åh
1187:MiritaÅgOh, is that right? That's unusual. Doing that is always Comet's job.Åh
1188:ShinkÅgIt is?Åh
1189:I'm somewhat surprised by Mirita's words.
1190:Although I shouldn't really be considering that I've seen Comet bringing her medicine before.
1191:ShinkÅgRather, those two get along well?Åh
1192:MiritaÅgThat's right. They both like reading and have similar hobbies. You might even say they're best friends.Åh
1193:ShinkÅgAh, I see.Åh
1194:There certainly are lots of books in Rin's room, and the first time I met Comet I think she was going to the library.
1195:It's good to have friends with the same interests.
1196:CometÅgYes, we're good friends. Any teacher who tries to tear us apart... won't be forgiven.Åh
1197:ShinkÅgWhoa!?Åh
1198:MiritaÅgAh, Comet, you were here. I can never sense you sneaking up on me.Åh
"As usual, there's no sign/hint/indication"
1199:CometÅgYour mistake is in trying to sense an inorganic substance like myself.Åh
Bleh.
1200:ShinkÅgYou scared the hell out of me...Åh
1201:Comet is like a doll so I can understand when she says she has no presence to be sensed.
Blehx2.
1202:However, she does have emotions and such so I think I should be able to feel some hint of her at least.
1203:CometÅgAnyway, professor, what are you doing? Depending on your answer... I'll ruin you.Åh
Depending on the circumstances. She uses í◊Ç∑, which means both "to crush" and "to ruin someone's plans"
1204:ShinkÅgDon't scare me like that... I don't have any ulterior motives. Rin just asked me to.Åh
1205:CometÅg...you're telling the truth. Weird, though.Åh
1206:ShinkÅgIs it really that weird?Åh
1207:CometÅgRin is friendly to everyone. However, she only entrusts me and other monsters she's close with to do things for her.Åh
"Me" might actually be "herself" é©ï™ is probably the shittiest word in Japanese, and this sentence has 2 of them.
1208:CometÅgFor her to ask a favor from the human professor is unimaginable. By what means did you get something on her?Åh
"What kind of trick grabbed her weakness?" I think you get what that means, but hard to state in English.
1209:ShinkÅgI'm telling you that I did nothing of the sort. I was simply helping her study.Åh
1210:Honestly, how badly does she want to discover that I'm a bad person?
1211:I'm not mad because I know she's only concerned for Rin, and it's good to see this aspect of Comet too.
It's good because one aspect of Comet is also seen (or I was able to see). This sentence is a mess. He's saying that he's happy to see Comet care for her friend.
1212:CometÅgSuspicious. But I'll ignore it. I'm not that narrow-minded a woman.Åh
1213:MiritaÅgGeez, Comet. You're so rude to him.Åh
1214:ShinkÅgIt's fine. I can see why she'd be uncomfortable having a human man getting close to her friend.Åh
1215:ShinkÅgBesides, I'm happy that I got to see Comet's gentle side.Åh
Affectionate part, happy=satisfied. You can see how this line explains 1193.
1216:CometÅg...what are you talking about?Åh
1217:As if surprised at what I said, Comet is momentarily speechless and suddenly averts her gaze.
1218:Did I embarrass her?
1219:Dining StaffÅgHere you are, professor! It's ready to take to her!Åh
1220:ShinkÅgAh, thanks. I appreciate it.Åh
1221:Dining StaffÅgIt's a good thing you're doing. Give my regards to the young lady.Åh
1222:ShinkÅgGladly.Åh
1223:She gives me a warm smile, hands me Rin's food, and returns to work.
1224:I've already been gone awhile, and I'd better go get this to Rin before it gets cold.
1225:ShinkÅgWell then, I'm outta here.Åh
1226:MiritaÅgAll right. Thanks for taking care of Rin.Åh
1227:CometÅgDon't do anything funny with her.Åh
1228:ShinkÅgYou know I won't.Åh
1229:Still displeased, Comet mutters to me. I remain pleasant with her and leave the dining hall.
1230:As I've figured, I can learn new things just from mingling with everyone like that.
1231:ShinkÅgRin? I'm back with your medicine and dinner.Åh
1232:RinÅgAh *cough* ... Professor Shink. Thank you.Åh
1233:ShinkÅgNo problem at all. Do you think you can eat? Don't push yourself if you can't.Åh
1234:RinÅgNo, I'm fine. Thanks for the food.Åh
1235:Rin takes her dinner from me and slowly begins nibbling on it.
Holds it in her mouth without chewing?
1236:While watching her eat, I prepare her medicine.
1237:RinÅgThat took you some time, I noticed.Åh
1238:ShinkÅgAh, yeah. I was talking with Mirita while I waited, and I ran into Comet too.Åh
1239:ShinkÅgBoth of them were worried about you. You have good friends.Åh
1240:RinÅgAhaha, they were? To a sickly girl like me... I'm not sure they're really my friends...Åh
1241:ShinkÅgNo, they are. There's no need to pity yourself so much.Åh
Self-abasement/humility/self-depreciation to that extent.
1242:RinÅgBut I cause them so much trouble...Åh
1243:ShinkÅgDon't think that way. Comet always brings your medicine, and I know from talking with her that she doesn't consider it trouble at all.Åh
1244:ShinkÅgThey've been your friends all along, even if you haven't noticed, and doing things to help your friends out is natural, not a burden.Åh
1245:RinÅgHmm... maybe you're right.Åh
1246:Rin gives me a relieved smile. Hopefully my little speech gave her a bit of confidence and peace of mind.
1247:RinÅgAha. You really do act like a real teacher, Professor Shink.Åh
1248:ShinkÅgWhat does that mean? I am a real teacher.Åh
1249:RinÅgI'm sorry, that's not what I meant. It's just that none of the other teachers have ever discussed things like this with me...Åh
1250:ShinkÅgThey aren't good teachers then.Åh
1251:Listening to students' worries is a teacher's job, after all.
1252:Are they neglecting her simply because she's repeated a few years and needs a lot of extra care?
1253:ShinkÅgBut Dr. Kyute would surely listen to you...Åh
1254:RinÅgShe's so busy... I didn't want to bother her...Åh
1255:ShinkÅgIt's fine. Kyute would be glad to talk with you about things like this.Åh
1256:Kyute is a natural-born teacher. I bet she's the type that would love for students to take their problems to her.
1257:I understand since I'm that way too. Being reliable is a big part of a teacher's job, in my opinion.
1258:RinÅgAha. You're right... I'll do that from now on.Åh
1259:ShinkÅgOof. You can keep relying on me too.Åh
1260:RinÅgSure! Thank you so much, Professor Shink!Åh
1261:Looking at Rin's beaming smile, I feel happy that she trusts me a bit now.
1262:If I can get on good terms student by student like this, I should be able to build up a relationship of trust with my class eventually.
1263:With that thought in mind, I continue chatting with Rin until she needed to take her medicine.
1264:RinÅgGood morning.Åh
1265:BibiÅgOh, this is rare. Are you feeling well today?Åh
1266:RinÅgYep. I've been great all morning.Åh
1267:BibiÅgThat's good. Then as usual, take notes for me.Åh
1268:RinÅgCome on, do it yourself once in awhile.Åh
1269:ShireneÅgSeriously. Don't you think you're just a bit too lazy, Bibi?Åh
INCOMING JAPANESE HUMOUR
1270:CometÅgAgreement. I can't stand all the delinquent students in this class.Åh
1271:MiritaÅgUmmm... haha?Åh
Umm... gag?
1272:BibiÅgHahaha, nice joke!Åh
1273:RinÅgYou're one to talk, Comet.Åh
That isn't a line you're allowed to say, Comet.
1274:CometÅgOoh, an unexpected retort. Thank you.Åh
Ç‹Ç≥Ç©ÇÃëçÉcÉbÉRÉ~ Can't think of anything better. Unexpected total riposte or something.
1275:ShireneÅgWhat are you thanking her for?Åh
1276:ShinkÅgHahaha...Åh
1277:Rin enters right as homeroom begins, gathering a group of students around her.
1278:I can't help but laugh at the scene of students chatting together, something I hadn't been able to see much of so far.
1279:RinÅgAh, Professor Shink. Sorry for disrupting homeroom.Åh
1280:ShinkÅgI don't mind. I don't have anything special to announce anyway.Åh
1281:CometÅgOh, I see. Hooray!Åh
or "Hear! hear!"
1282:ShinkÅgShow a little more restraint, Comet. And Bibi, take your own notes.Åh
1283:BibiÅgHahaha, well put, Professor. I like being told so directly.Åh
I feel good when I am told so clearly/plainly.
1284:MiritaÅgYou shouldn't have to be told though...Åh
"It's only natural though..."
1285:ShinkÅgAnyway, as long as you aren't too noisy, you may do what you want until class begins.Åh
1286:I start preparing for class and watch to see what everyone will do while I wait for homeroom to end.
1287:I'm happy to see that no one is boldly walking out during homeroom.
1288:Not long ago, Bibi and Comet would leave without hesitation, but perhaps since Rin is here, they seem to be staying.
1289:RinÅgProfessor Shink, do you have a moment?Åh
1290:ShinkÅgHuh? What's wrong? Do you have a question about today's class?Åh
1291:RinÅgAh, no... it's not about class. Can I talk to you a minute?Åh
1292:ShinkÅgHmm?Åh
1293:I act like I'm thinking for a bit.
I show a thinking gesture? I have no idea what that's supposed to mean. I don't think he's pretending to think though.
1294:I've finished preparing for class so I don't have anything particular to do. I can't find any reason to refuse her.
1295:ShinkÅgSure, no problem.Åh
1296:RinÅgAha, that's a relief. Come over here and let's talk.Åh
1297:ShinkÅgH-hey, you don't have to drag me.Åh
1298:Apparently happy that I said yes, Rin grabs my hand and hauls me over to where she sits.
1299:RinÅgHere, Professor, please sit.Åh
1300:CometÅgHey... Rin. That's my seat.Åh
1301:RinÅgAh, that's right. Sorry Comet. Stand up.Åh
1302:CometÅgWhat horrible treatment. I'm sad. Poor teacher...Åh
Same insulting word for teacher she used in 971 with a derogatory "you" in front of it.
1303:ShinkÅgDon't say things like that.Åh
1304:It's all right though. I know she's joking.
1305:BibiÅgHmm? It looks like you're getting pretty cozy with the professor, Rin. Did something happen?Åh
Sensei's relative importance to Rin is getting larger.
1306:RinÅgUmmm, is that what it looks like? I just wanted a bit of advice from him.Åh
1307:ShireneÅgAdvice from that guy? Give me a break. That's a waste of time.Åh
1308:RinÅgNo it's not. How about asking him for help yourself?Åh
1309:ShireneÅgYou've got to be joking. Depend on a human? Hmph.Åh
1310:RinÅgAh, Shirene!Åh
1311:BibiÅgOh my. It looks like she really hates you. You have my sympathy.Åh
1312:ShinkÅgWasn't that partly your fault too, Bibi?Åh
1313:Although without her there, it probably wouldn't have changed much.
1314:When it comes to Shirene, I guess I'll be in it for the long haul.
I have no choice but to look at the long term.
1315:CometÅgÇ”Ç¡ÅAÇ¥Ç‹ÇüÅh
Joke, She says Ç”Ç¡ÅAÇ¥Ç‹Çü, which is "Hah (derisively), sad sight" But Ç‘Ç¥Ç‹ is like rude, repulsive, revolting, disgraceful
1316:ShinkÅgI told you, keep the jokes to yourself.Åh
1317:I don't care, but still...
1318:CometÅgI only said it because it's you. It's proof that I trust you, so to speak.Åh
1319:ShinkÅgI don't believe that for a second.Åh
That's a lie.
1320:CometÅgYes.Åh
Engrish.
1321:ShinkÅgHaa...Åh
1322:CometÅgBut I certainly am intrigued. It's surprising to see Rin so emotionally attached.Åh
1323:RinÅgEmotionally attached...? I'm not a pet...Åh
1324:BibiÅgWhat, you want to become a pet, Rin? I'll keep you then.Åh
1325:Student 1ÅgKyaa! Let me be your pet, Bibi!Åh
1326:Student 2ÅgCool! Me too, please!Åh
1327:ShinkÅgWhat the!?Åh
1328:Where did THAT come from!?
1329:BibiÅgHm, eventually.Åh
1330:MiritaÅgAs always, she has tons of groupies.Åh
Followers, hangers-on
1331:RinÅgI didn't mean that I wanted to be a pet or anything...Åh
1332:BibiÅgOh, that's a shame.Åh
1333:ShinkÅgIs this how it always is when you're all around?Åh
1334:Noisy? Boisterous maybe? Is it because they're all women?
1335:BibiÅgNo, not usually. Hmm, I wonder what's different today?Åh
1336:RinÅgIt's because Professor Shink is here. That's enough to make me happy.Åh
1337:ShinkÅgH-hey...?Åh
1338:R-really...?
1339:CometÅgDid something really... It's good to see Rin laughing energetically, but curious...Åh
1340:MiritaÅgYeah, but I'm glad. Rin looks like she's having fun.Åh
1341:BibiÅgHmm, if she were here, I wonder how much of an uproar she'd cause. It's a pity she isn't.Åh
1342:ShinkÅgShe...?Åh
1343:BibiÅgYeah, the serial class cutter. Way worse than Comet and I.Åh
1344:ShinkÅgGah... There's another one of you I haven't met?Åh
1345:I thought Shirene was the most troublesome, but it appears I might be wrong.
1346:MiritaÅgAuu, I wonder where she's gone this time...Åh
1347:RinÅgI'm sure she'll come back eventually.Åh
1348:ShinkÅgShe isn't even on campus?Åh
1349:Suppressing my feeling of dread for the student I haven't yet met, we keep talking for awhile.
1350:I'm happy to feel like I've bridged the gap between us, even if only a little.
1351:ShinkÅgOkay, it's time for class.Åh
1352:RinÅgAh, you're right. I wanted to talk with you more though, professor.Åh
1353:ShinkÅgHaha, we can talk whenever you have time. Let's start class now.Åh
1354:BibiÅgSleep time then.Åh
1355:CometÅgAnd I'll read...Åh
1356:ShinkÅgHey, you two delinquents. Take your classes seriously for a change.Åh
1357:BibiÅgIf it's interesting, I'll consider it.Åh
1358:CometÅgIf I feel like it.Åh
1359:ShinkÅgSigh... fine. I'll just have to earn it.Åh
I'll just have to make a great effort
1360:MiritaÅgAh, ahaha... Good luck.Åh
1361:Mirita forces a laugh, but the two delinquents don't make any attempts to pay attention.
1362:Have they already given up trying? Oh well, maybe it's good that they have low expectations.
1363:ShinkÅgAnyway, take your seats everyone. It's time for class to start.Åh
1364:Student 1ÅgIf I feel like it.Åh
1365:Student 2ÅgYeah, yeah.Åh
1366:ShinkÅgSo enthusiastic...Åh
1367:RinÅgYes! I'm enthusiastic!Åh
1368:ShinkÅgYou seem to be the only one...Åh
1369:Rin replies with a big smile as I stand up and walk over to the lectern.
1370:Now then, today's going to be a tough one.
1371:ShinkÅgHuh...? Hey, is that...Åh
1372:After class, I'm headed back to my room to prepare for tomorrow when I see Rin staggering down the hall.
1373:From her red face and clumsy manner of walking, I can tell she isn't feeling well.
1374:ShinkÅgRin, are you all right? You look extremely tired.Åh
1375:RinÅgAh, Professor Shink. Yes, I'm fine.Åh
1376:ShinkÅgNo, despite your claim to the contrary, you don't look fine at all.Åh
1377:RinÅgAh, aha. I'm fine. This is fairly normal for me, at least. If I go back to my room and rest...Åh
1378:ShinkÅgH-hey!Åh
1379:Brushing off my concern, Rin acts tough and heads towards her room.
1380:She looks so bad she could collapse at any second though...
1381:Even if she says this is normal for her, I can't help but worry.
1382:ShinkÅgCome on, don't overdo it. Here, lean on my shoulder and I'll walk with you.Åh
1383:RinÅgB-but I'm fine... You don't have to worry about me so much...!Åh
1384:ShinkÅgRin!?Åh
1385:After stubbornly refusing my help, as I feared, Rin doesn't make it far before she crumples to her knees.
1386:I rush over to support her, but she goes limp as if she's lost consciousness, putting her full weight on me.
1387:ShinkÅgDamn, I told you so! Hey! Someone help!Åh
1388:Student 1ÅgHuh, what's up, professor... Whoa, Rin!?Åh
1389:ShinkÅgWhew, I need some help! I'm going to carry Rin back to her room. Go fetch Dr. Kyute!Åh
1390:Student 2ÅgGot it! Come on, let's hurry!Åh
1391:Student 1ÅgOkay! Take care of Rin, professor!Åh
1392:ShinkÅgOf course!Åh
1393:Entrusting some students passing by with telling Kyute, I shoulder Rin and walk to her room, doing my best to keep her steady.
1394:KyuteÅgShe was just a bit tired out. I think she should wake up in a short while.Åh
1395:ShinkÅgIs that so? That's a relief...Åh
1396:Kyute arrived right after me and checked on Rin's condition. It appears not to have been anything serious.
1397:Breathing a sigh of relief, I plop down in a chair.
1398:ShinkÅgShe looked a lot better than usual this morning though.Åh
1399:KyuteÅgRin's condition can suddenly change without any warning. It'd be nice if the other professors would pay closer attention to her...Åh
1400:ShinkÅgYou're saying they pretty much ignore her?Åh
1401:KyuteÅgYes. I'm embarrassed to admit it, but... Well, no one else has much concern for your class of students.Åh
1402:ShinkÅgUgh...Åh
1403:That makes me frown and cross my arms in discontent.
1404:With so many students, I understand it's impossible to keep watch on all of them, but they know Rin has a weak constitution.
1405:How could a teacher just ignore that?
1406:KyuteÅgBut it's been a big help having you here. Thanks.Åh
1407:ShinkÅgNo, it's the least I could do.Åh
1408:Being thanked for something that should be common decency is kind of embarrassing.
"Because I'm only doing what is to be expected, being thanked to this extent is honestly an embarrassing thing." My sentence is a bit loaded, but seems to fit the tone of the conversation, if not the line itself.
1409:KyuteÅgHehe, you're so kind. Is it all right if I leave Rin in your care?Åh
1410:ShinkÅgSure. Sorry to bother you while you're busy.Åh
1411:KyuteÅgNo no, it's the least I could do.Åh
1412:Kyute responds in a somewhat joking manner, mimicking my earlier line, as she leaves.
1413:After seeing her off, I look down at Rin, still sleeping.
1414:Perhaps she got worn out attending class after it had been so long. Not being able to go out is kind of sad when she looks forward to it so much.
1415:ShinkÅgI feel so helpless.Åh
1416:Even though she wants to go to class and hang out with her friends, she is rarely able to.
1417:That must be lonely and very hard on her.
1418:ShinkÅgI wish I could do something for her...Åh
1419:PhamÅgOh, that's good. Keep going down that path.Åh
1420:ShinkÅgSeriously, you come out of nowhere.Åh
1421:PhamÅgYep. That's what I do.Åh
1422:I heard a voice behind me, apparently agreeing with my muttering.
1423:Despite her sudden appearance, I'm used to it already. With a sigh, I turn around and confront Pham.
1424:PhamÅgHmmm, so she collapsed after all... She was in such high spirits too. Such a shame.Åh
1425:ShinkÅgYeah, it is... Maybe she did enough today to make her happy, though.Åh
1426:PhamÅgOh? I don't think that was all she wanted.Åh
1427:ShinkÅg...? What do you mean?Åh
1428:PhamÅgWho knows? Even I don't know this girl's feelings.Åh
1429:PhamÅgBut perhaps there was something she was looking forward to more than going to class and talking with her friends?Åh
1430:ShinkÅg...you think so?Åh
1431:Something about student life she'd enjoy besides class and her friends...
1432:Not a single thing comes to mind...
1433:PhamÅgHehe, perhaps you don't understand.Åh
1434:ShinkÅg......Åh
1435:PhamÅgThat's wonderful too, though... Well, that's nothing to worry about for now.Åh
1436:PhamÅgThat aside, will you stay by her side until she wakes up?Åh
1437:ShinkÅgYeah, I plan on it.Åh
1438:PhamÅgThat's good. Hang in there then.Åh
1439:ShinkÅgHang in there? What are you... hey!Åh
1440:Pham whispers something that sounds strangely meaningful, but before I can question her, she disappears as if running away.
1441:Honestly, what could Pham's goal possibly be...
1442:ShinkÅgI have no idea...Åh
1443:I quickly put that out of mind. No matter how much I think about it, I'm not going to understand the meaning behind Pham's words and actions.
1444:Hmm, should I read a book while I wait for Rin to wake up?
1445:RinÅgUgh... ngh...Åh
1446:ShinkÅgOh, are you awake?Åh
1447:Hearing Rin's voice after a short time has passed, I look up from my book and check on her.
1448:RinÅgHuh...? Professor Shink...Åh
1449:ShinkÅgYeah...?Åh
1450:She looks pretty strange, like she's being eaten up by fever.
1451:Is she really all right...?
1452:RinÅgAha, Professor Shink, what are you doing in my room?Åh
1453:ShinkÅgI carried you back after you collapsed and stayed to watch over you.Åh
1454:RinÅgHehe, really? I'm so glad...Åh
1455:ShinkÅgHey now, don't push yourself.Åh
1456:Rin gives me a big smile and starts to get out of bed. 
1457:I jump up from my chair to try to stop her, but she's faster. She hops down and runs over to me.
1458:ShinkÅgWhoa, why are you running!?Åh
1459:RinÅgAhaha... Professor Shiiiiink!Åh
1460:ShinkÅgWhoa!?Åh
1461:She unexpectedly leaps at me. Unable to dodge, we flop onto the floor together.
1462:Pressed down beneath her soft body, I can feel Rin's body heat against my skin.
1463:ShinkÅgOw, h-h-hot!?Åh
1464:RinÅgAha, you smell... so very nice, professor... Haaa...Åh
1465:ShinkÅgWhat are you doing, Rin!Åh
1466:Her body heat is nearly scalding, and on top of that, her speech and behavior have become incredibly odd.
1467:What the hell has gotten into her!?
1468:RinÅgNgh, I feel good for some reason... I can't hold back... I want to eat you up...Åh
1469:ShinkÅgWait!? Hold on, calm down!Åh
1470:RinÅgUngh... Too late... I can't stand it any longer... Time to eat, Professor!Åh
1471:ShinkÅgWh-whoa!?Åh
1472:In a panic, I try to tear Rin off me, but she's considerably stronger than I am. Trapped underneath her, I can't even move.
1473:Flashing me a broad grin, Rin begins stripping my clothes off until I'm nearly nude.
1474:RinÅgHehe, ngh... So this is Professor Shink's penis... Mmm, it smells good...Åh
1475:RinÅgThe smell is so strong even from this far away...Åh
1476:ShinkÅgStop it, Rin! Gah, what are you doing...!Åh
1477:We roll around on the floor together as she undresses me further.
1478:As if stuck in a trance, Rin stares at my manhood and softly massages it with her hand.
1479:I try to resist her, but the difference in our strength makes that impossible.
1480:RinÅgNgh, please don't struggle so much... It'll all be over soon, okay?Åh
1481:ShinkÅgAll be over soon...? What do you mean...Åh
1482:RinÅgDon't worry... I'll make you feel good, hehe... So you shoot it all out...Åh
1483:With that, Rin begins slowly giving me stimulation.
1484:RinÅgMmn, chp... Mmmpch... If I stimulate you like this, your penis will really like it...Åh
1485:RinÅgI'll lick your nipples... and tenderly rub your balls... Mmmpch...Åh
1486:ShinkÅgKuaa, Rin... Stop...Åh
1487:I feel a rough sensation and a lukewarm dampness circling around my nipples.
1488:Below, the hand massaging my testicles is completely inhuman, possessing a dual hardness and tenderness particular to the dragon race.
1489:She cups my balls in her palm, and each time she rolls one between her fingers, my twitching manhood leaps up in convulsions.
1490:RinÅgHehe... Your penis is trembling in my hand... It's so cute...Åh
1491:RinÅgProfessor Shink... how is it? It doesn't hurt, right? Ssspst, mmmcchp...Åh
1492:ShinkÅgIt doesn't hurt... but please stop...Åh
1493:I try to reign Rin in, but as if she's lost in a world of her own, my words aren't getting through to her.
1494:My balls being rubbed increases the blood flow to my manhood and produces more semen at the same time.
1495:When I think about being fondled by a girl like Rin, my penis fills with strength and instantly becomes erect, whether I wanted it to or not.
1496:RinÅgHaaa... So this is a penis once it gets hard... It's so big and strong...Åh
1497:RinÅgChp, mmn... I'll gently caress you like this... So professor, please concentrate on coming...Åh
1498:ShinkÅgNgh, kuaaa...Åh
1499:Rin shifts her entranced gaze to my erect manhood and slides the hand massaging my balls up to begin stroking my shaft.
1500:Feeling a dragon's hand for the first time, it trembles in delight, leaping back and forth in violent spasms.
1501:RinÅgMmmpch... Don't come... so easily...Åh
1502:RinÅgBut it's all right... I'll stroke you nice and slowly... and be really gentle so you'll enjoy it...Åh
1503:Rin affectionately rubs my manhood and treats me with the utmost delicacy. Where did she even learn how to do this?
1504:Then, as if unsatisfied with the gentle stimulation, my penis jumps up and pushes into Rin's hand.
1505:RinÅgMmmpch... Oh, does this mean you want it harder?Åh
1506:RinÅgI was holding back... because you're a human... but it looks like I don't have to... Well then...!Åh
1507:Rin's eyes glaze over, and her hand that was previously moving timidly gives my shaft a firm squeeze.
1508:ShinkÅg...!!Åh
1509:RinÅgAh, it's really throbbing in my hand now... It feels so good...Åh
1510:RinÅgYour nipples... Mmpch, ssst... are getting harder too... How about if I do this?Åh
1511:ShinkÅgUgh, gah...!Åh
1512:Rin watches my reaction as she takes a tight grasp on my shaft and begins to move her hand up and down.
1513:Her rubbery palm presses into my flesh, which causes my penis to spring up and push back against her.
1514:Having ascertained my exact point of weakness, Rin flashes me an intoxicated-looking smile and resumes stroking.
1515:RinÅgHaaa... If I squeeze right here, it really throbs... Oh I see, it feels good here, doesn't it?Åh
1516:RinÅgAnd... sspst, mmngh... When I lick your nipples while stroking you up and down... you look so happy.Åh
1517:ShinkÅgNgh, Rin... That's enough...Åh
1518:As I feared, I can't take this much longer...
1519:My penis throbs under Rin's precise stimulation, and my sexual desires begin to override my better judgment.
1520:I feel even better each time her palms and the scales on the back of her hand touch me. As proof, precum leaks out of my urethra.
1521:RinÅgAha, mmchp... It smells so strong... It's really turning me on.Åh
1522:RinÅgBeing able to receive so much pleasure... makes me so happy. Here, let me make you feel even better.Åh
1523:ShinkÅgUgh, Rin... If you, there...!Åh
1524:Rin scoops up my precum with her finger and reaches out to smear it all over my shaft.
1525:With the viscous liquid added, the sensation coming from her palm becomes smoother.
1526:My penis twitches from the new feeling, and a tingling like an electric current runs up my spine.
1527:RinÅgIt's getting harder and harder... At this rate, you're going to come soon, aren't you...Åh
1528:RinÅgHow am I doing? Is there anything else you want me to do? Please, just give the word...Åh
1529:ShinkÅgUngh, please... just stop...Åh
1530:She doesn't stop no matter how many times I ask. As if simply seeking pleasure, she continues stroking my penis.
1531:My head goes numb from all the stimulation, and I can't even think straight any longer...
1532:RinÅgHaa, mmmpch, sspst... You stopped reacting well for some reason... Should I make it more intense?Åh
1533:RinÅgOr maybe... it's not your penis, but here that you want me to be rougher?Åh
1534:ShinkÅgUgh...!Åh
1535:While observing my reaction, Rin nibbles on my erect nipple.
1536:A sharp sensation runs through my body. I lurch upwards, and precum dribbles from my dick.
1537:RinÅgMmpch, ngh... I knew it. You definitely prefer a little pain... Here, let me do this then.Åh
1538:RinÅgMmmchp, haa... Your nipple is getting hard... while I pull on it with my teeth...Åh
1539:ShinkÅgUngh...Åh
1540:Rin smoothly strokes my penis between the intermittent sharp pains.
1541:Caught between the dual stimulation, I'm forcefully carried away by pleasure, unable to resist.
1542:My dick is already erect to the point that it hurts, and I can feel my cloudy magma being drawn out from deep inside me.
1543:ShinkÅgGah, Rin... Any more and...!Åh
1544:RinÅgAh, aha... You're going to come soon? That's fine, please shoot it out whenever you're ready...Åh
1545:RinÅgAim your dick at me... and cover me in your fragrant cum!Åh
1546:Realizing that I'm close to ejaculation from my reaction, Rin begins stroking my shaft even more intensely.
1547:Occasionally her claws scratch it, adding to the pain from her biting my nipple and causing my dick to strongly push back against her.
1548:RinÅgHehe, come on, please... Your penis is screaming that it wants to release too.Åh
1549:ShinkÅgAaah, can't hold!Åh
1550:RinÅgAaah!!Åh
1551:Right as I hit my limit, Rin bites down on my nipple and squeezes my shaft.
1552:That's enough to send me over the edge. My pent-up desires gush out as my dick trembles in her hand.
1553:RinÅgNgh, haaa... So this is an ejaculation? It smells amazing... I could get addicted to this...Åh
1554:ShinkÅgKuh, haaa... Rin, I finished so... Please...Åh
1555:RinÅgWhat are you talking about? Your dick is still so big...Åh
1556:RinÅgHehe, now that I know you like it kind of rough, this time I'll be even more forceful...!Åh
1557:While staring enraptured at my ejaculation, Rin, with some idea in mind, begins to pinch my soft flesh between her claws.
1558:ShinkÅg...ngh!!Åh
1559:My body involuntarily spasms as a nail scratches a sensitive area.
1560:As a result, an even more violent stimulation is sent into my dick.
1561:RinÅgAah, pch... Your dick is throbbing so much... It must be feeling really good.Åh
1562:RinÅgIf I claw you like this... See? Your whole body jerks upwards!Åh
1563:RinÅgYour smell is getting even stronger... And not just your dick, but your balls are jiggling around...Åh
1564:Rin licks my nipples while she scratches my dick with her claws, hitting me with a combination of pain and pleasure.
1565:The two sensations become muddled together, and my manhood, not able to tell the two apart, reacts to both equally.
1566:RinÅgAh, it's getting bigger again and pounding profusely... You're going to come again, aren't you...Åh
1567:RinÅgThis time... please shoot out even more... Lots! Enough to cover my face!Åh
1568:ShinkÅgAgh, kuh...! I'm going to come!Åh
1569:She gives me a powerful squeeze and digs her nails in deep. As my dick trembles in delight, a wave hits me, more powerful than before.
1570:No longer able to control myself, my body shakes and spasms.
1571:RinÅgMmmngh, I can smell it... Come on, please give it to me...!Åh
1572:RinÅgI'll squeeze your dick hard... So drench me in your delicious-smelling semen!Åh
1573:Rin stimulates my penis as she shouts, quickly sending me over the edge.
1574:ShinkÅgUgh, kuaaaa!!Åh
1575:RinÅgAha, you got it all over me... It's sticky and feels weird...Åh
1576:RinÅgIt smells wonderful though... Just sniffing its odor is making me feel strange...Åh
1577:ShinkÅgHaa, haa...Åh
1578:I breathe heavily and stare at Rin, who looks happy to be bathed in semen.
1579:I never would have expected Rin to do anything like this...
1580:RinÅgNow I've got to clean up properly...Åh
1581:Without me understanding what she means, Rin looks at the semen on her hands and body and begins licking it off.
1582:RinÅgChp, mmmpch... It tastes weird, but for some reason it's making me feel better...Åh
1583:RinÅgThis is the taste of semen... When I think about how you smell... it tastes so delicious...Åh
1584:ShinkÅgIt can't... possibly...Åh
1585:I gasp feebly, but Rin shows no reaction. With doubt in my mind, I avert my gaze.
1586:RinÅgNgh, zzzz, zzzzz...Åh
1587:Moments later, Rin falls asleep with a happy look on her face...
1588:ShinkÅgShe fell asleep like this...? Sigh...Åh
1589:Seeing Rin, I sigh, gently extract myself from underneath her, and begin cleaning us off.
1590:RinÅgHuh...? Why am I...?Åh
1591:ShinkÅgMorning.Åh
1592:As if she's awoken from her trance, Rin looks around with an expression of confusion.
1593:Myself exhausted, I can't do anything but greet her.
1594:RinÅgProfessor Shink... Huh, OH!Åh
1595:ShinkÅgYou just remembered?Åh
1596:RinÅgAh, aaaaah! I'm so sorry! I can't believe I did that!Åh
1597:ShinkÅgYeah, well...Åh
1598:Outrageous as it may have been, if this leaks out, it'll be me that suffers.
1599:That aside, she sure looks awfully energetic...
1600:RinÅgWaaah, why did I do that...Åh
1601:ShinkÅgStop. I don't intend to talk about what happened. More importantly, are you feeling well?Åh
1602:RinÅgHuh? Ah, yes. I'm fine. My body feels great for some reason.Åh
1603:ShinkÅgR-really...?Åh
1604:Squeezing out my semen improved her condition, perhaps?
1605:So in other words...
1606:ShinkÅgHey, Rin... Does your species, uhh... Use that as a source of nutrition?Åh
1607:RinÅgWhat!? I, I've never heard that before!Åh
1608:RinÅgTo begin with, why would I... When I got a whiff of your scent, I completely lost control of myself!Åh
1609:ShinkÅgCalm down a second. It doesn't make any sense, but...Åh
1610:With a sidelong glance at Rin who's going crazy, I consider what just happened as calmly as I can.
1611:Rin collapsed because of her poor health, jumped on me, then forced out my semen.
1612:Next, she fainted, and when she woke up, she was energetic.
1613:No matter how I piece it together, I can't escape the conclusion that my semen was nourishing to her.
1614:Come to think of it, I have heard that genital fluids from the opposite sex are a source of energy for monsters.
1615:ShinkÅgAs I suspected, it looks like what we did earlier is the cause of your newfound energy.Åh
1616:ShinkÅgIs it possible that this is the only reason you haven't been feeling well until now?Åh
1617:RinÅgWaa... It's so embarrassing when you say that so calmly.Åh
1618:ShinkÅgAh, I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.Åh
1619:When Rin looks at me red-faced and embarrassed, even I blush remembering what just happened between us.
1620:As you'd imagine, this is going to require some delicacy...
1621:ShinkÅg.........Åh
1622:RinÅg......Åh
1623:Gah... This is a painfully awkward silence.
1624:Nevertheless, even if I should say something, I don't know the right thing to say...
1625:RinÅgAh, ummmm... Professor Shink...Åh
1626:ShinkÅgUh... yes?Åh
1627:RinÅgYou didn't... mind, did you?Åh
Line 1627 is more literally "That wasn't unpleasant for you, was it?"
1628:ShinkÅg...huh?Åh
1629:RinÅgSorry, having that sort of thing done to you by a girl like me... m-must have been awful.Åh
1630:ShinkÅg......Åh
1631:In addition to her shyness, Rin looks like she's being crushed by regret while I stand there silently.
1632:What she did was certainly problematic, but blaming her for it here isn't going to help matters.
1633:ShinkÅgActually, it was pretty good.Åh
1634:RinÅgWhat...!Åh
1635:ShinkÅgI was certainly surprised by its suddenness, but since you needed the energy, that's fine, right?Åh
1636:ShinkÅgBesides, I doubt there's a single guy alive who would mind being with a cute girl like you.Åh
1637:RinÅgWha...!? Please don't tease me, Professor Shink...Åh
1638:ShinkÅgHuh? I wasn't trying to tease you at all.Åh
1639:Rin really is cute, and what reason would I have to lie about that anyway?
1640:Still, as though she didn't believe me, Rin blushes even redder than before and stares at me with tears in her eyes.
1641:RinÅgR-really...? I, I'm a cute girl?Åh
1642:ShinkÅgYeah, I guarantee it. Whatever that's worth, I guess.Åh
1643:RinÅgN-no! It's worth a lot! I'm so happy!Åh
1644:ShinkÅgIs that so... One more thing, you're a bit close...Åh
1645:RinÅgHaaa!? Sorry!!Åh
1646:I put some strength into my words to hold back Rin as she approaches. She panics, and I give her a wry smile.
1647:She sure has become assertive now that she's healthy.
1648:ShinkÅgAnyway, I'm fine, but you should take it easy today. We don't know if your energy is only temporary.Åh
1649:RinÅgAh, okay. But... hehe, if I collapse, I might need your help again... Kidding. Ha, haha...Åh
1650:ShinkÅgDon't tease adults like that. I'm going now.Åh
1651:RinÅgOkay. Umm, thank you so much, really.Åh
1652:ShinkÅgIt's fine, it's fine.Åh
1653:Rin bows her head and waves goodbye as I leave her room.
1654:In the end, it's good that Rin was able to recover her strength.
1655:ShinkÅgAll right. Is everyone present?Åh
1656:CometÅgI'm nooot!Åh
1657:ShinkÅgActual absences only, please.Åh
1658:CometÅgNo, no, that's too much. Being praised is embarrassing.Åh
1659:ShinkÅgI'm not praising you though.Åh
1660:BibiÅgIs this some kind of comedy skit?Åh
1661:ShireneÅgI'd rather they skip the worthless introduction.Åh
1662:MiritaÅgAh, ahahaha...Åh
1663:ShinkÅgGah...Åh
1664:I tried to play along, but everyone's a critic.
1665:Well, I figured this would happen, but considering the situation, having Comet in a good mood will be valuable.
1666:CometÅgStop your idiotic thoughts and get this over with. You're wasting time.Åh
1667:ShinkÅgSure.Åh
1668:Even Comet is harsh with me.
1669:ShinkÅgWell then, back to attendance...Åh
1670:RinÅgProooofessor Shiiiink! Good morning!Åh
1671:ShinkÅgUngh!?Åh
1672:I'm rammed just as I try to take attendance. I manage to stay on my feet, but it was a close call.
1673:What the hell was that...
1674:ShinkÅgRin...?Åh
1675:RinÅgYep! Good morning, Professor Shink. Pleased to see you again.Åh
1676:ShinkÅgAh, yeah... morning.Åh
1677:She's awfully excited. Did something happen this morning?
1678:RinÅgHehehe. You're looking good today, Professor.Åh
1679:ShinkÅgUm, okay... thanks? But, umm... you shouldn't hug me like this.Åh
1680:RinÅgWhy not? We're partners now.Åh
She says "skinship" Might need some editing depending on later conversation.
1681:ShinkÅgWait, what?Åh
1682:What is that supposed to mean?
1683:I appreciate her friendliness, but...
1684:MiritaÅgEh, eeeh...? Wh-what's going on?Åh
1685:BibiÅgI'm not sure, but it's about to get good.Åh
1686:ShireneÅgWh-what shameless...Åh
1687:BibiÅgNo, it's probably nothing particularly shameful. Or perhaps I should say, it's old-fashioned.Åh
I think she's trying to say that sex is a time-honored tradition or something like that, not something to be ashamed about.
1688:CometÅg...Rin? What in the world...Åh
1689:RinÅgHuh? Thanks to Professor Shink, I'm feeling great. Shouldn't I thank him for that?Åh
1690:MiritaÅgThanks to... the professor?Åh
1691:RinÅgYep! I don't know how to put it, but... Professor Shink and I have an inseparable bond now, I guess?Åh
1692:ShinkÅgShh...!?Åh
1693:Don't say it like that! That's going to cause a huge misunderstanding!!
1694:BibiÅgOoh, an inseparable bond? Hehe, that's rather suggestive, isn't it?Åh
1695:MiritaÅgEh? Eeh!? Th-that means... Don't tell me...!Åh
1696:RinÅgI may not be able to live without Professor Shink now...Åh
1697:ShinkÅgIf that's the case, then...!Åh
He just says "Therefore...!" He's trying to say that if she can't live without him, she better shut up or he's going to get killed.
1698:CometÅgI, I can't believe it... What a scandal...Åh
1699:ShinkÅgNo, you're wrong! It isn't a scandal or anything!Åh
1700:Please give me a break! At this rate my career as a teacher is over!
1701:No, worse than that, given my surroundings...
1702:ShireneÅgYou bastard! What did you do to Rin!!Åh
1703:ShinkÅgHold up! I know what you're thinking, but that's not what happened!Åh
1704:ShireneÅgThere's no point arguing! Prepare yourself!!Åh
1705:RinÅgShirene! What do you think you're doing!?Åh
1706:ShireneÅgNgh, stand aside, Rin! I'm going to make this human pay!Åh
1707:RinÅgI won't let you! I'll protect Professor Shink!Åh
1708:ShireneÅg...how has he won you over so strongly? No way, he brainwashed you!?Åh
1709:ShinkÅgDon't jump to crazy conclusions!Åh
1710:Brainwashing!? How the hell could a teacher do something like that!
1711:MiritaÅgAaaah... Stop it you two! No fighting!Åh
1712:Student 1ÅgOoh! Fight! Fight! Fight!Åh
1713:Student 2ÅgGood luck, Rin! You too, Shirene!Åh
1714:ShinkÅgHey, stop egging them on!Åh
1715:Aaah, shit! This is getting too chaotic!!
1716:BibiÅgHeheh, haha, ahaha! This is great! She really loves you!Åh
1717:ShinkÅgDon't laugh! Stop them!Åh
1718:BibiÅgNo way. It'd be bad form to stop something that might prove interesting.Åh
1719:ShinkÅgGah, you're a real piece of work, you know that?Åh
1720:BibiÅgI humbly accept your kind words.Åh
Obvious sarcastic exchange.
1721:No good, Bibi is useless! Where's Comet...
1722:CometÅgGigigi, I never thought Rin would... I won't forgive you, teacher.Åh
There's that bad word for teacher again.
1723:ShinkÅgNo good there either...Åh
1724:RinÅgI'm in excellent shape today so I can stand up to you!Åh
1725:ShireneÅgUngh, move aside, Rin!Åh
1726:ShinkÅg...I've had enough!Åh
1727:MiritaÅgWait, Professor!? Please stop!Åh
1728:ShinkÅgI have to. Go study by yourselves. Or do whatever you want, just don't cause any trouble.Åh
1729:Student 1ÅgAll right!Åh
1730:Student 2ÅgThat's my kind of class!Åh
1731:MiritaÅgHeyyy! Get your act together!Åh
1732:ShinkÅgHaa...Åh
1733:Meh, they'll probably calm down soon enough.
1734:More importantly, Rin looked like she was having fun. Let's stop thinking so deeply about all this.
1735:The students enjoying themselves is the most important thing, after all...
1736:Lost in thought, I lean against a window and look up at the beautiful, blue sky.
1737:MiritaÅgYou can't escape reality!Åh
1738:Maybe, maybe not.
More like "don't care, don't care"
1739:ShinkÅgAah, this tea is so good...Åh
1740:I sip on tea with breakfast, trying to soothe the fatigue of everyday life.
1741:After a month of working here, I can finally say I've gotten used to teaching at the academy.
1742:I can't say I've developed a relationship of mutual trust with my students though.
1743:ShinkÅgNone left, huh?Åh
1744:While pondering things over, I notice that my cup is now empty.
1745:I've still got time for another...
1746:RinÅgI'll get you more tea, Professor!Åh
1747:ShinkÅgYeah, thanks.Åh
1748:RinÅgNo problem. It's so early though. Are you usually up at this hour?Åh
1749:ShinkÅgYeah, I'm a teacher. Kind of. I've got lots of things to prepare for classes. Speaking of, you're sure up early today, too.Åh
"I'm a teacher for the time being" maybe? àÍâû is ambiguous.
1750:We carry on a casual conversation while she fetches me another cup of tea.
1751:I think this is the first time Rin has been out of bed before I'm done with breakfast.
1752:RinÅgYeah, I am, I guess. I woke up early for some reason and got lucky to run into you!Åh
1753:ShinkÅgI see...Åh
1754:Ever since Rin's condition improved, she's been incredibly energetic.
1755:Her body is still somewhat weak, but she acts a lot more emotional and cheerful.
1756:She hasn't been missing too many days of classes lately either, which is encouraging.
1757:RinÅgHehe, I'm going to get up this early every day from now on.Åh
1758:ShinkÅgWouldn't it be better to get enough sleep? You stay up rather late, don't you?Åh
1759:RinÅgEh? That's not true. I try to go to bed as early as I can.Åh
1760:ShinkÅgReally? That's fine, then. Just don't strain yourself, okay?Åh
1761:RinÅgI won't!Åh
1762:Rin makes a sharp nod with a smile on her face, then sits down and begins eating breakfast with me.
1763:I slowly drink my tea while looking at her.
1764:ShireneÅg...ungh.Åh
1765:ShinkÅgOh...Åh
1766:RinÅgAh, Shirene. Were you out training like usual?Åh
1767:ShireneÅgYeah. It's critical that I train every day if I want to beat her.Åh
1768:ShinkÅg...her?Åh
1769:ShireneÅgHmph. It's none of your business, got it? Don't pry into my affairs.Åh
1770:ShinkÅgAh, yeah... I understand...Åh
1771:I reply, although I'm slightly disappointed that she still talks to me like that.
1772:Even after a month, Shirene's attitude towards me hasn't changed at all.
1773:I know our first meeting couldn't have gone any worse, but she should have softened up a little by now at least...
1774:ShinkÅg...is that asking too much?Åh
1775:Without some kind of change, doing something about Shirene's hated for humanity is impossible.
1776:Perhaps it's going to be a matter of time before we can resolve this issue.
1777:I wish a good opportunity would present itself...
All 3 lines there are one big thought. He's essentially saying that he needs something to occur to give him an opportunity to prove that humans aren't bad, and it might just take time for that opportunity to present itself.
1778:ShireneÅgFurthermore, I see you're still with this guy, Rin. I'm really impressed. I don't know what you see in humans though.Åh
She's actually being very nice to Rin, I think.
1779:RinÅgCome on, Shirene. You're being rude to Professor Shink.Åh
1780:ShireneÅgWhatever. I didn't mean to complain about your tastes. Best wishes.Åh
1781:RinÅgAh, wait, Shirene!Åh
1782:Having said her piece, Shirene shrugs her shoulders and trots out of the dining hall.
1783:Well, that was predictable...
Following conversation was insane to translate. Fuck ó]óT. It was already #1 on my most hated Japanese words.
1784:ShinkÅgWhy is she always so uncomposed and on edge?Åh
Why is she always so uncomposed, fussy, nervous, restless, on edge. Why does she make a big deal out of everything?
1785:RinÅg...on edge?Åh
1786:ShinkÅgYeah. I could understand her if she were simply serious and prudish, but her hatred for humanity? Well, I do understand somewhat.Åh
1787:But more than that, I feel like she makes a big deal out of everything.
1788:She's always so tense, or rather, if she doesn't loosen up a bit, she's liable to collapse.
Collapse, be prone to getting sick/hurt
1789:RinÅgAhhh, good job, professor. Just from the little you've spoken with us, you can sure tell a lot.Åh
"You're seeing exactly about us" or some such.
1790:ShinkÅgWell I am a teacher after all. Besides, I've been alive longer, even if only a little bit. I can understand that much.Åh
Another shitty sentence.
1791:RinÅgIs that right? You really are amazing.Åh
1792:ShinkÅgR-really...?Åh
1793:Being praised so directly is really embarrassing.
1794:ShinkÅgDo you have any idea why Shirene is like that?Åh
1795:RinÅgNot exactly... Shirene doesn't talk about herself much.Åh
1796:RinÅgIf she were here, she might know a little more...Åh
1797:ShinkÅgShe?Åh
1798:CometÅgVera, Shirene's rival. Well, the rivalry only goes one way.Åh
1799:ShinkÅgWhoa!?Åh
1800:While talking with Rin about Shirene, I suddenly hear a voice beside me.
1801:Surprised, I turn my head to look and see Comet eating there nonchalantly.
1802:ShinkÅgWh-when did you...Åh
1803:CometÅgPretty much the whole time. You just didn't notice me.Åh
1804:ShinkÅgSeriously?Åh
1805:Am I that dense?
1806:CometÅgWell, never mind, never mind. On another note, this is delicious, have a bite.Åh
1807:ShinkÅgHuh...? You're giving this to me?Åh
1808:CometÅgYeah, don't hold back. Ah, I didn't lace it with poison so don't concern yourself with that.Åh
1809:ShinkÅgNo, I didn't suspect that even for a second.Åh
1810:Why would I have to worry about receiving poisoned food from my students?
1811:CometÅgOh, is that so? Then here you are.Åh
1812:ShinkÅgAh, thanks.Åh
1813:I take the food she offered and raise it to my mouth.
1814:Come to think of it, this seems unexpectedly sudden. But it's not like I did anything bad to her, did I...?
1815:CometÅg...are you really going to eat it?Åh
1816:ShinkÅgWhich do you want?Åh
1817:CometÅgTch, you hesitate to taste it because of a single phrase. You're surprisingly chicken, professor.Åh
1818:ShinkÅgYou're such a pain.Åh
1819:CometÅgI try.Åh
"Because I'm aiming"
1820:ShinkÅg...sigh.Åh
1821:She's in her usual form. Even after a month, I haven't gotten used to her at all.
1822:RinÅgGrrr, professor! Try this too! It's really good!Åh
1823:ShinkÅgHuh...? Um, I'm honestly full already though...Åh
1824:RinÅgOoh, so you'll take food from Comet, but not from me?Åh
1825:ShinkÅgNo, that's not...Åh
1826:CometÅgAnd the winner is... Comet!Åh
1827:ShinkÅgStop antagonizing her. You're just confusing the situation.Åh
1828:When she talks with such a straight face, I can't tell whether she's really trying to stir shit up or just joking around.
1829:For now, I guess it's better to take Rin's food and avoid creating any discord.
1830:ShinkÅgAll right, I'll eat yours too. Happy?Åh
1831:RinÅgYes! Here you go, professor.Åh
1832:I take the offered food from Rin and eat it against my will.
1833:I definitely can't force down any more after this...
1834:CometÅgHmm. It appears she likes you more than I expected. Why... It's a mystery. Reasons unknown.Åh
1835:ShinkÅgHuh...? Is something wrong?Åh
1836:CometÅgNo, sorry to disturb you. Please resume your breakfast fun time.Åh
1837:ShinkÅgH-hey!Åh
1838:I think I hear Comet grumble something under her breath as she stands up and rushes out of the dining hall.
1839:What was she really after...?
1840:RinÅgWhat was that all about?Åh
1841:ShinkÅgWho knows...Åh
1842:Rin and I stare at one another, both of us puzzled by Comet's strange behavior, while we finish breakfast.
1843:ShinkÅgHaaa... So tired.Åh
1844:After all my morning classes are over, I head up to the roof to take a breather.
1845:Since classes are still in session, the roof is deserted, making it the perfect place to relax.
1846:Occasionally students will skip classes and come up here so I take the time to patrol at the same time.
1847:ShinkÅgNot many students have been hiding on the roof lately though...Åh
1848:PhamÅgProbably because of how often you come here?Åh
1849:ShinkÅgOh ho, the elusive phantom appears. Wearing a uniform today, I see.Åh
1850:PhamÅgYes, I feel like wearing it sometimes. Does it look good on me?Åh
1851:ShinkÅgYeah, I guess it suits you. Aren't you hot though?Åh
1852:Pham appears in her usual manner, but this time she's wearing a school uniform. It's the winter one though and obviously looks hot.
1853:It's warm out given that this is the summer term so I have to imagine those long sleeves are sweltering.
1854:PhamÅgOh, I'm a ghost, remember? I don't get hot or cold.Åh
1855:ShinkÅgI see. Being a ghost sounds surprisingly convenient.Åh
1856:PhamÅgIf it suits you, shall I invite you? If I become so minded, you can join our ranks at once.Åh
Archaic Japanese usage of invite. Also that line needs work. Meaning should be clear.
1857:ShinkÅg...ungh.Åh
1858:The instant Pham flashes me an ominous smile, my body is enveloped by discomfort.
Too literal.
1859:Rather, I'm starting to get the feeling that I want to die.
"Rather" is just an intensifier. "Like I want to die (as it is/without change)... that mood continues to become." Awkward to phrase in English. Maybe "The longer I stand here, the more I feel like I want to die."
1860:ShinkÅg...ungh, haaa... Sorry, I don't want to die yet...Åh
1861:PhamÅgHeheh, don't worry. I don't have any intention of killing you.Åh
1862:PhamÅgHowever... let this be a lesson that you shouldn't speak so carelessly, okay?Åh
1863:ShinkÅgUgh, phew... Haa, haaa... I'll bear that in mind.Åh
1864:Pham waves her hand, and the discomfort crushing my body disappears, blown away by fresh air.
1865:I breathe in as much as my lungs will hold then let out a long sigh of relief.
1866:She really wasn't joking around just now.
1867:I let my guard down thinking I was acclimated to being here, but I probably still need some measure of caution as a human...
1868:PhamÅgDo you understand now? If you relax your attention too much, you may not live to regret it.Åh
She says "If you relax your attention too much, you will die, you know?"
1869:PhamÅgThere are still plenty of students who do not trust you, after all.Åh
1870:ShinkÅgYeah. Thanks for the warning. That might have been a little overkill though...Åh
1871:PhamÅgYou humans never take a lesson seriously unless you learn the hard way.Åh
"the hard way" is somewhat of a figure of speech, but its literal meaning "feel it with your body" is apt here too.
1872:ShinkÅgThat may be true.Åh
1873:Still, I wish she had taken it a bit easier on me, but I'll keep my mouth shut.
1874:Her warning has a lot of truth to it, but why is Pham concerned about me?
1875:PhamÅgI wonder. What do you think?Åh
1876:ShinkÅgStop reading my mind... And how am I supposed to know why?Åh
1877:PhamÅgThat's not the right attitude. Think it through. The truth will not be found by one who does not seek it.Åh
1878:ShinkÅgAnother puzzle...Åh
"Another difficult thing" Maybe he's complaining that she refuses to answer his questions again
1879:PhamÅgIt really isn't. If you can't think for yourself, then won't anything I say become the truth?Åh
Probably can be worded better. "Won't you believe anything I say?" maybe
1880:ShinkÅgYeah, I suppose. I get what you're trying to say more or less, but in a roundabout way.Åh
1881:PhamÅgSorry, just how I am. That aside, do you mind?Åh
Do you mind = "is that all right, I wonder?" or some such
1882:ShinkÅgHuh? Mind what?Åh
1883:PhamÅgHehe, behind you, behind you.Åh
1884:ShinkÅg...??Åh
1885:Pham laughs and points behind my back. Puzzled, I look over my shoulder.
1886:CometÅgHi.Åh
1887:ShinkÅgHa...?Åh
1888:CometÅgThat was a rather interesting monologue. I was just getting curious.Åh
1889:ShinkÅgGah, Comet!? When on Earth did you...!Åh
1890:CometÅgAbout when you suddenly began to groan in pain. Your acting was so good I almost applauded by accident.Åh
1891:CometÅgHowever, if you don't outgrow doing that soon, it will be pitiful.Åh
1892:ShinkÅgOoof...!Åh
1893:When she puts it so seriously, it really is pitiful! Wait...!
1894:ShinkÅgThat wasn't acting! Look, she was...Åh
1895:CometÅg...ahh, you were personifying your delusions? That's worse than pitiful, it's pathetic.Åh
1896:ShinkÅgEh...?Åh
1897:PhamÅgAah, that's right. You're the only one who can see and hear me, by the way.Åh
1898:ShinkÅgWhy didn't you say so!?Åh
1899:So wait, everything up until now has looked like me talking to myself...
1900:My gestures and reactions too?
1901:That, that's pitiful! Even people watching would feel like running away!
1902:ShinkÅgN-no... You've got the wrong idea!Åh
1903:CometÅgIt's all right, I understand. You're tired. Get some rest, okay?Åh
1904:ShinkÅgAs usual, your behavior changes at whim...Åh
"Words and deeds change frequently"
1905:Just when I get used to her speaking respectfully, she switches to single words and short phrases. I don't understand her character at all.
1906:CometÅgWell, there's nothing wrong with me. Worry about yourself right now.Åh
1907:CometÅgDespite the lie, your pitiful actions... are interesting indeed. I'm quite intrigued.Åh
Or maybe "the pitiful actions of a habitual liar" but he hasn't told more than one to her
1908:ShinkÅgIs that so?Åh
1909:It's all a misunderstanding... And anyway, I'm not that interesting of a human.
1910:PhamÅgNo, you're plenty interesting. That girl's evaluation is correct.Åh
1911:ShinkÅg......Åh
1912:Must resist... If I say anything more to Pham, I'll look like a total weirdo.
1913:It might already be too late, but let's not make it worse.
1914:CometÅgHuhu, all right. I've gotten fired up. Professor, I have something to tell you.Åh
Terrible. Her emotions are fired up, fired up in love, burning with desire, etc. Something to tell you is the same verb used when someone admits they have a crush on someone. "I have an announcement to make here" etc.
1915:ShinkÅg...something to tell me?Åh
1916:CometÅgYes. I was thinking of searching for how you became so intimate with Rin in only a few days after arriving, but I've changed my mind.Åh
1917:CometÅgI've now become interested in you personally. Very much so. Yes, to the extent that I'll give up reading.Åh
1918:ShinkÅgAh, really now...Åh
1919:CometÅgI'm going to observe you around the clock from now on... Please prepare yourself.Åh
She actually asks him for permission, but certainly doesn't seem like it.
1920:ShinkÅgWhaa!?Åh
1921:That was her announcement!? That she's going to become my stalker!?
1922:CometÅgThat's all for now. Ku ku ku ku...Åh
1923:ShinkÅgWait, Comet!? Comeeeeeeeeet!!Åh
1924:Ignoring my shouts for her to stop, Comet leaves with an ominous laugh.
1925:It's so creepy that I get goosebumps and shiver...
1926:ShinkÅgGive me a break... How sad is it that I have to be stalked by a student?Åh
Funky sentence, might be wrong
1927:PhamÅgOh my, good luck with that. Hehe...Åh
1928:ShinkÅgThis is partly your fault too!Åh
1929:PhamÅgOops, scary scary. Good byeeeeee!Åh
She talks like Comet here. Maybe intentional?
1930:ShinkÅgH-hey!Åh
1931:I draw closer to Pham in an attempt to complain to her, but she nimbly dodges and then disappears.
1932:I guess there's no way I can search for her now.
1933:ShinkÅgWhy did this have to happen...Åh
1934:I squat down and just stare dumbfounded for awhile.
1935:ShinkÅgIn other words, you should be thinking here that...Åh
1936:It's been a few days since Comet's pronouncement. On its face, the time has passed quietly... or so it appears.
He's saying that it only LOOKS tranquil/peaceful.
1937:However...
1938:CometÅgJiiiiiiiiiii.Åh
1939:ShinkÅgUh... that...Åh
1940:CometÅgJiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii.Åh
1941:ShinkÅg.........Åh
1942:This is incredibly hard.
1943:Seriously, why does she never take her eyes off me for a second...
1944:ShinkÅgAah, Comet? Do you have a question?Åh
1945:CometÅgNo, I'm just observing. Ignore me.Åh
1946:ShinkÅgO-okay...Åh
1947:As if it's possible to ignore her...
1948:RinÅgUm, Comet? You know you're bothering Professor Shink when you stare at him like that?Åh
1949:CometÅgOh? Did I do something wrong?Åh
1950:RinÅgNo, it's just that he can't continue class like this...Åh
1951:CometÅgI don't really care. That has nothing to do with me.Åh
1952:ShinkÅgUgh...Åh
1953:Please care a little... I can't teach anything at this rate.
1954:ShireneÅgEven Comet... What in the world is she thinking?Åh
1955:BibiÅgBeats me. Comet's thought process is beyond anyone's ability to comprehend. Worrying about it is useless.Åh
1956:BibiÅgOn the other hand, this situation is quite interesting. Don't you agree?Åh
1957:ShireneÅgNot at all. It also bothers me that class can't continue. Oh well, do whatever you want now.Åh
1958:BibiÅgHeheh, that's reasonable. It doesn't look like this is going to be settled any time soon. Time to sleep.Åh
1959:ShinkÅgHey now...Åh
1960:Shirene and Bibi both stop paying attention to me.
1961:When I look around, the other students are all beginning to do whatever they please too.
1962:I can't blame them when class is at a standstill, but this is really bad, isn't it?
1963:CometÅgHmm, when the professor can't continue class, the students do what they want. As expected. Not a very interesting result.Åh
1964:RinÅgYou understand what you're doing? Come on, cut it out, Comet.Åh
1965:CometÅgHmm, I seem to have caused you trouble. I won't apologize, but please continue.Åh
1966:ShinkÅgHey look...Åh
1967:Perhaps because she got some results from her observation, Comet looks down and begins taking notes.
1968:She's probably summarizing this observation, but she wants me to teach too.
1969:ShinkÅgHaaa... that's enough. We still have a bit of time left so use it for self-study.Åh
1970:Student 1ÅgAh, lucky!Åh
1971:CometÅgOh, strange. I expected the professor would continue class even if by force.Åh
1972:CometÅgThis alters my assessment. Human psychology is quite difficult.Åh
1973:RinÅgComet! Sigh, never mind. Professor Shink, can I have a second to ask you something?Åh
1974:ShinkÅgHmm? Could you just study by yourself like the others?Åh
1975:RinÅgI want you to teach me though!Åh
1976:ShinkÅgReally now...Åh
1977:Wow, she really has become emotionally attached. Not that it's a bad feeling.
1978:CometÅgAs suspected, Rin is... hmm. Why so much... I'm worried. Have they gone that far?Åh
1979:Comet mumbles something or other under her breath, but I ignore her.
1980:I sigh and answer Rin's questions, talking over the noisy hum of the classroom, until the bell chimes.
1981:ShinkÅgGotta hurry!Åh
1982:I walk quickly down the hall, trying to make up for the extra time it took me to prepare for classes.
1983:I don't let myself break out into a run, even though I might be a bit late at this pace.
1984:ShinkÅgThis place is surprisingly large.Åh
1985:As I complain to myself to stay occupied while walking, I suddenly feel like someone's watching me.
1986:However, when I look around, I don't see any students looking in my direction.
1987:ShinkÅgJust my imagination?Åh
1988:Even if it is only my imagination, the feeling is rather disconcerting.
1989:It kind of feels like someone's observing me...
1990:ShinkÅgHa, there!?Åh
1991:CometÅgOops, I've been spotted. Your perception has become quite sharp.Åh
1992:ShinkÅgSo it was you all along.Åh
1993:I had a hunch that it was Comet keeping her eyes on me. It seems I was right on the money.
1994:ShinkÅgHave you been watching me all this time?Åh
1995:CometÅgOf course. I've been observing since you started preparing for classes.Åh
1996:ShinkÅgHey now...Åh
1997:I didn't notice her at all earlier. As usual, she has quite the aptitude for spying.
1998:CometÅgHmm. Your normal walking stride is roughly 20 to 30 centimeters.Åh
1999:CometÅgWhen hurrying, it's over 50. I see, I see.Åh
2000:ShinkÅgCan I ask something? Of what use is that information?Åh
2001:CometÅg...? I'm learning your personality.Åh
2002:ShinkÅgThrough my stride...?Åh
2003:CometÅgOf course. That's perfectly natural. Are you an idiot?Åh
2004:ShinkÅgNo, but...Åh
2005:If pushed, I'd have to say Comet is the idiot of the two of us, but I'd better keep my mouth shut.
2006:However, judging the character of a person by their gait is certainly a novel idea.
2007:ShinkÅgI don't have time for this. I need to hurry.Åh
2008:CometÅgIs that right? By all means go.Åh
2009:ShinkÅgNo, you need to return to the classroom as well. Class is about to start.Åh
2010:CometÅgWhat's the point of going to a class without the professor?Åh
2011:ShinkÅgIt's refreshing to hear you speak so normally.Åh
2012:CometÅgSo embarrassing. My impression of you increases.Åh
2013:ShinkÅgThat wasn't a compliment!Åh
2014:Speaking of which, what kind of impression is she even talking about?
2015:CometÅgOh well, I don't care. You're going bald, you know?Åh
2016:ShinkÅgI'm not going bald! Gah, whatever! Anyway, are you coming?Åh
I don't get the bald thing. Pulling his hair out in frustration, I guess? It isn't any kind of idiom I can discover.
2017:CometÅgComing? How obscene. I'll have to add a note that the professor is a lecher.Åh
2018:ShinkÅg.........Åh
2019:I'm tired of her jokes already. I'm out of here.
2020:I head back to the classroom, leaving Comet behind while she begins to write something down.
2021:ShinkÅg......Åh
2022:Dinner time. As I eat, I look around restlessly, searching.
2023:Since I've encountered Comet everywhere I've gone today, I can't help but worry she's in here observing me from somewhere.
2024:ShinkÅgIs she really not here?Åh
2025:As far as I can see, Comet is nowhere to be found.
2026:She might suddenly pop up behind or beside me like usual, but as long as I'm alert, that shouldn't happen.
2027:RinÅgWhat's wrong? Why are you looking around so much?Åh
2028:ShinkÅgAah, Rin. I'm worrying about whether Comet is here or not.Åh
2029:RinÅgAh! D-don't tell me, professor... You and Comet...Åh
2030:ShinkÅgWait! What's gotten into you? Or better yet, why is this such a shock?Åh
2031:RinÅgBecause... I can't believe you'd fall for that patchwork girl.Åh
Hard to translate ÉoÉâÉoÉâñ∫
2032:ShinkÅgHow can you say something that awful so casually...Åh
Talking about her insult of Comet
2033:Aren't Rin and Comet friends?
2034:Or are they actually not that close?
2035:RinÅgAm I not good enough for you!?Åh
Maybe a stretch. "Am I not suitable" "Do you not like me"
2036:No, that's not it. I'm worrying too much.
2037:ShinkÅgSorry, did you say something?Åh
2038:RinÅg...no, it's nothing.Åh
2039:ShinkÅgReally?Åh
2040:RinÅgYes. I guess I'm not...Åh
Stupid incomplete sentences. She's saying "I guess I'm no good after all." Her usual self-pity and lack of confidence. This is pretty obvious in Japanese, but hard to construct a partial English sentence that gets the meaning across and still leave a little room for Shink to be confused
2041:ShinkÅg???Åh
2042:Rin suddenly became dispirited. Perhaps she really did say something important?
2043:CometÅgThat's a demerit. However, it's easy to lose sight of your surroundings when lost in thought. Hmm, another brilliant discovery.Åh
FIXME Ç‹ÇΩé˚änÇ†ÇËÇ≈Ç∑? I think it's right...
2044:ShinkÅgFrom below!?Åh
2045:RinÅgComet, where did you come from?Åh
2046:CometÅgWell, since the area was being watched, I figured going underneath the table would work.Åh
2047:ShinkÅgThat's funny. Well done, really.Åh
2048:CometÅgPraised. Oh no, embarrassing.Åh
2049:ShinkÅgI'm just shocked.Åh
2050:RinÅgThat's indecent all the same. You're a girl too Comet, how could you...Åh
2051:CometÅgHmm, I'll take your advice into consideration. However, words for self-respect are not in my vocabulary.Åh
Self-respect could also be prudence, restraint
2052:ShinkÅgThat makes you really free...Åh
Bleh. Meaning clear at least?
2053:That was her primary way of speaking. It's like she has multiple personalities.
2054:CometÅgAh, that reminds me. I have some good information for you, professor. You'll be happy. No doubt.Åh
Good news? Juicy information?
2055:ShinkÅgHuh? Good information?Åh
2056:CometÅgYes. Feel free to be choked with tears in appreciation for me.Åh
2057:ShinkÅgIt's that good, is it?Åh
2058:I'm extremely curious, but why am I also scared at the same time?
2059:RinÅgHey, can I hear what it is too?Åh
2060:CometÅgOh? No problem. Actually, this wouldn't be possible if you hadn't been here.Åh
2061:RinÅgEh? What do you mean?Åh
2062:CometÅgYou'll understand when I tell you. Then I think you'll get too worked up over black.Åh
After, black thinks it's too fired up. WTF does this mean? FIXME I guess
2063:RinÅg...eh!?Åh
2064:ShinkÅg...black?Åh
2065:CometÅgI know, I was surprised. I never would have guessed black. Well, it's quite good on Rin.Åh
Guessing on that last sentence. Ç¢Ç‚ÅAÉäÉìÇ‡Ç»Ç©Ç»Ç©
2066:RinÅgC-c-c-comet!? Wh-what are you talking about!?Åh
2067:CometÅgWhat are they called... panties, your color.Åh
2068:ShinkÅgGuh...!Åh
2069:Did she just tell me what I think she did?!
2070:And how is that good information anyway!
2071:RinÅgKyaaa! Why did you tell him that!? Better yet, why were you looking!?Åh
2072:CometÅgI wasn't looking, they were just visible. You were too careless.Åh
2073:RinÅgAs if I'm usually worried about people being under the table!Åh
2074:CometÅgOooh scary, scary. That's all from me. How you use this information is up to you, professor.Åh
2075:ShinkÅgWa...!?Åh
2076:CometÅgAdieu!Åh
2077:Leaving us with that, Comet scampers away.
2078:We're left in such an awkward situation that we can't even look at one another.
2079:What are you supposed to tell a girl after unexpectedly learning what color underwear she has on?
2080:RinÅgUmmm, Professor Shink... About that...Åh
2081:ShinkÅgDon't worry about it. I'll pretend I never heard.Åh
2082:This is as embarrassing as it gets. It'd be best to just forget as soon as possible.
2083:RinÅgIt's fine if you don't want to pretend though...Åh
2084:ShinkÅgHuh? Are you all right?Åh
2085:RinÅgY-yes! I'm fine! Ah, I'll go get dessert!Åh
2086:ShinkÅgH-hey!Åh
2087:Rin flashes me a smile in an attempt to evade the question and runs over to the counter.
2088:She's probably too ashamed to stay here with me.
2089:ShinkÅgI wonder if she'll be back in a few moments.Åh
2090:Without too much concern, I continue my meal.
Wasn't he stuffed and done already?
2091:But what am I supposed to do about Comet...
2092:ShinkÅgNgh... haaaa, morning already?Åh
2093:Sunshine beams through my window, waking me up.
2094:Considering how nerve-wracking yesterday was, I really hope nothing happens today.
2095:ShinkÅgWait, huh? It looks like there's a bulge under my covers...Åh
2096:CometÅgGood morning, professor. You wake up surprisingly early.Åh
2097:ShinkÅgAh, Comet? Morning...Åh
2098:Huh? Comet...?
2099:Shink
2100:ÅgWhat the fuuuuuuuuuuuck!Åh
2101:CometÅgToo loud. Could you be a bit quieter?Åh
2102:ShinkÅgNo! What are you doing here!? And where's the rest of you??Åh
2103:CometÅgI'm sleeping with you, obviously. I left my body behind because it would be too shameful.Åh
2104:ShinkÅgAnd it isn't with just your head!?Åh
2105:CometÅgNot really. Without my body, I'm not worried about you doing anything perverted.Åh
2106:ShinkÅgThat's not a good reason!Åh
Your logic is strange, reason is funny, etc.
2107:The trauma of waking up next to a severed head is a much more real concern.
2108:And I'd bet anything that even Comet realizes that.
2109:KyuteÅgShink? Is something the matter? I heard you yelling just now...Åh
2110:ShinkÅgGah! Kyute!?Åh
It's actually really weird that everyone calls Shink by what I assume is his first name, even the students.
2111:Oh shit. If she sees me with Comet, I'm not going to get off lightly!
I won't manage to just be told off
2112:CometÅgUh oh, big trouble?Åh
2113:ShinkÅgKeep quiet! Damn, what do I do...!Åh
2114:KyuteÅg......? I'm coming in, okay?Åh
2115:ShinkÅgWait, hold on!Åh
2116:I try to hide Comet's head somewhere, but my efforts are in vain. Kyute opens the door and walks in.
2117:It's all over for me.
2118:KyuteÅgExcuse me for barging... Comet!?Åh
2119:CometÅgHi. Nice morning, isn't it?Åh
2120:KyuteÅgAh, yes it is. Fine weather we're... wait a minute! What's going on here!!Åh
2121:ShinkÅgNothing! Nothing at all!Åh
2122:CometÅgHow cruel! After how intensely you embraced me last night... oh oh oh.Åh
2123:ShinkÅgI wish you'd stop saying things like that!Åh
2124:CometÅgYou really did embrace me though. Your chest was a lot more muscular than I expected.Åh
2125:KyuteÅgShink...? I need to have a few words with you.Åh
2126:ShinkÅgHold on! This is all a big misunderstanding!!Åh
2127:KyuteÅgI don't want to hear your excuses! You need to be taught a lesson!!Åh
2128:ShinkÅgThis isn't fair!Åh
2129:CometÅgHu hu hu, good luck, professor.Åh
2130:ShinkÅgHave some pity on me and tell her the truth!Åh
2131:Aah, damn it! I don't want to be lectured all morning.
2132:I've just gotta explain the situation here somehow...
2133:RinÅgProfessor Shink! Help! Comet's head is...!!Åh
2134:ShinkÅgHey... hey!!Åh
2135:Somehow I feel this is about to get even more complicated.
2136:RinÅgOh! Why is Comet in your room... Don't tell me...!Åh
2137:ShinkÅgThere's nothing to tell you! Nothing happened, okay!?Åh
2138:CometÅgNo, last night was a lot of fun.Åh
2139:ShinkÅgStop stirring shit up!Åh
2140:RinÅgNo way... I never dreamed you'd... with Comet...Åh
2141:ShinkÅgWhy are you believing her!?Åh
2142:Am I that untrustworthy!?
2143:Even so, that's a shocking thing to suddenly believe!
2144:KyuteÅgWhatever! Sit down, Shink! And Rin, get Comet out of here.Åh
2145:RinÅgB-but I want to hear what he has to say too.Åh
2146:KyuteÅgSorry. I need to drill some sense into him. Got it?Åh
2147:RinÅgUgh... All right, I understand. Come on, Comet.Åh
2148:CometÅgOh, sorry to make you go to the trouble.Åh
2149:RinÅgAfter this, you can tell me what happened.Åh
2150:CometÅgI have no idea what you're talking about. Anyway, see you later, professor.Åh
2151:ShinkÅg...sigh.Åh
2152:With Comet's head in hand, Rin leaves the room, leaving me to put my own head in my hands and sigh.
Works better in Japanese.
2153:I just got up and I'm already suffering...
2154:KyuteÅgShink, are you ready?Åh
2155:ShinkÅgI guess nothing I say will change your mind. Just go easy on me...Åh
2156:Already resigned to my fate, I obediently sit down in front of Kyute, who has a vengeful smile on her face.
2157:I can only hope this is over quickly...
2158:RinÅgComet, what's your deal?Åh
2159:CometÅgHuh, what do you mean?Åh
2160:RinÅgDon't play dumb. Crawling into Professor Shink's bed and stalking him every day, don't you think you're going too far?Åh
2161:CometÅgAm I? How about you join me then?Åh
2162:RinÅgHuuh!? Crawling into his bed with you... *Gulp*Åh
2163:RinÅgTh-that could work... yeah. I didn't want you alone with him, but if we're both there...Åh
2164:MiritaÅgWhat are you saying, Rin!? That's not any better!Åh
2165:BibiÅgHahaha, this is my kind of conversation.Åh
2166:ShinkÅgI want all of you to cut it out.Åh
2167:I came to the dining hall after Kyute's admonishment was over where I overhear an absurd conversation.
2168:Not just Comet, but even Rin is acting crazy.
2169:RinÅgPro-professor Shink!? That was just a figure of speech! I was only joking!Åh
2170:CometÅgToo flustered. Very suspicious. Rin has a dirty mind.Åh
2171:RinÅgStop that! That's just because you were saying strange things!Åh
2172:CometÅgDon't blame me. I didn't do anything wrong.Åh
2173:KyuteÅgNonetheless, you went too far this time. You obviously do not have permission to sleep in the same bed.Åh
2174:CometÅgTch, oh well. If that's it, I can manage.Åh
2175:ShinkÅgNo, I'd appreciate it if you'd stop doing all the other things too.Åh
2176:Primarily to reduce my stress level.
2177:MiritaÅgThat's right. It's super suspicious to follow him around everywhere.Åh
2178:ShinkÅgOh? Tell me more.Åh
2179:BibiÅgHaving to rely on others? That's shameful.Åh
2180:ShinkÅgGah... I can't win.Åh
2181:As it stands, it seems impossible to get out of this situation.
2182:I feel like no matter which way I step, I'm walking straight into a minefield.
2183:MiritaÅgAnyway Comet, why do you have such an interest in Professor Shink?Åh
2184:CometÅgWhy...? That's another difficult question.Åh
2185:ShinkÅgThat's a difficult question?Åh
2186:CometÅgIt is. I'd say that's exactly what I'm trying to find out.Åh
2187:CometÅgI want to know why I'm interested in you.Åh
2188:ShinkÅgHuh?Åh
2189:That sure is an awfully hard thing to figure out.
2190:RinÅgThat doesn't mean you can stalk him and stuff. Give him some space, you're stressing him out.Åh
2191:CometÅgAnd I'm not stressed?Åh
2192:RinÅgThat's not the point!Åh
2193:ShinkÅgStop, stop! Look, it's time to head to class.Åh
2194:Just as the atmosphere around the table gets tense, I interject and clap to break everyone up.
2195:Even if this hurts my relationship with them, we're probably never going to meet halfway on this issue.
2196:It'd be better to completely start over from here.
2197:KyuteÅgThat's right. This conversation is over. To class everyone.Åh
2198:RinÅgUh, if you say so...Åh
2199:CometÅgWell then, see you later.Åh
2200:MiritaÅgWait, Comet! The classroom isn't that way!Åh
2201:BibiÅgHmm. Guess I'll go too. I don't see Shirene though... Seriously, I wish she had been here to join in on this topic.Åh
2202:ShinkÅg...whew.Åh
2203:The students say their respective farewells and file out of the dining hall.
2204:Seeing them leave, I let out a sigh of both relief and fatigue.
2205:Why do these things keep happening to me? I can't figure it out.
2206:KyuteÅgHuhu, that's enough for today. Those girls sure do seem to have taken a liking to you.Åh
2207:ShinkÅgIt'd be nice if that were true...Åh
2208:KyuteÅgDon't worry, even Comet will settle down sooner or later.Åh
2209:ShinkÅgThat would be great too... Well, I'd better get going.Åh
2210:KyuteÅgAll right. Work hard.Åh
2211:Noticing the time, I quickly stand up to leave.
2212:I bow to Kyute for her words of encouragement and head back to prepare for class.
2213:As usual, I have a mountain of problems facing me.
2214:ShinkÅgHuh...?Åh
2215:I was worried after everything that happened this morning, but Comet still hasn't shown up.
2216:Lately, given that her goal is to observe me, I'm naturally concerned whenever she appears.
2217:Though perhaps she found it hard to come to class after our quarrel.
2218:ShinkÅgUmm, has anyone seen Comet?Åh
2219:MiritaÅgAfter what happened earlier, she looked like she was going somewhere and not coming to the classroom.Åh
2220:BibiÅgWell, it would be hard to be here after that, not that she regularly comes to class anyway. Don't sweat it, professor.Åh
2221:ShinkÅgNo, that's hardly acceptable.Åh
I can't do/say that.
2222:RinÅgAre you worried about Comet, Professor Shink?Åh
2223:ShinkÅgWell...Åh
2224:I want her to attend class, and I'm concerned about this morning.
2225:Given Comet's personality, I shouldn't stress myself out over this, but I'm worried nonetheless.
2226:ShireneÅgShe's simply returned to her normal ways. You're just wasting your time caring about her.Åh
2227:ShinkÅgYeah, that may be true, but that sounds insulting to her.Åh
2228:ShireneÅgAs if you have a right to talk about that. If you're so worried, why not look for her? We don't need you to study.Åh
2229:ShinkÅgGuh...Åh
2230:She's as harsh as always. Shirene may actually study without me here, but the other students probably won't.
2231:Actually, they've been listening to me lately so maybe I can trust them now.
2232:RinÅgUgh. I'd be happier with Professor Shink here.Åh
2233:MiritaÅgBut Comet might be awkwardly embarrassed too. She might not be worried about it though.Åh
2234:BibiÅgHahaha, she isn't nearly that fragile. I would prefer the professor leave though. Then I can sleep openly in class.Åh
2235:ShinkÅgPlease keep that to yourself.Åh
2236:They each tell me their individual preferences, but at the end of the day, I'm the one in charge.
2237:That said, I really am worried. Maybe it'd be better to see if I can find her.
2238:BibiÅgHmm, I can tell from your face that you want to go, but didn't all those things she did cause you a lot of trouble?Åh
2239:ShinkÅgNo, not trouble so much as... anxiety.Åh
2240:If there's even a difference. Worries are worries.
2241:RinÅgAhhh, you're really soft-hearted, Professor Shink.Åh
2242:ShinkÅgAm I really?Åh
2243:I'm personally not convinced that I'm that nice of a guy.
2244:MiritaÅgIt makes me happy to know that you consider our feelings.Åh
2245:ShinkÅgUm, isn't it natural that a teacher would worry about his students?Åh
2246:ShireneÅgHmph. I still don't know whether you're being honest or not.Åh
2247:RinÅgThat's enough, Shirene! You're out of line.Åh
2248:ShireneÅgOh shut up. This is how I deal with humans, and I'm unlikely to change my mind now.Åh
2249:BibiÅgHeheh, so thickheaded. I think you need to be more open-minded.Åh
2250:ShireneÅgNo, you're just too carefree. Don't you have any pride as a monster?Åh
2251:BibiÅgLet's see... I wonder. I do and I don't.Åh
2252:ShinkÅgAll right, that's enough you two. Fighting amongst yourselves isn't going to accomplish anything.Åh
2253:Feeling that the atmosphere has taken a sudden turn for the worse, I break them up.
2254:It sure feels like this class doesn't have much unity.
2255:ShinkÅgAnyway, I'm going to go look for Comet. As for today's class, just study by yourselves I guess.Åh
2256:RinÅgAww, that's no fun. But if you say so...Åh
2257:MiritaÅgThanks for looking out for Comet. Good luck.Åh
2258:ShinkÅgAye.Åh
2259:Student 1ÅgDon't do anything naughty just because it's during class time!Åh
2260:Student 2ÅgWow, professor... I never knew that's what you were after.Åh
2261:ShinkÅgI'm not! I'm giving you all additional homework when I get back.Åh
2262:Student 1ÅgWhat!? That's uncalled for!Åh
2263:ShinkÅgI don't want to hear it.Åh
2264:Threatening the students with extra homework for making jokes at my expense, I leave the classroom.
2265:Now, where would Comet be...
2266:ShinkÅgI knew I'd find you here.Åh
2267:I headed to the library to look for Comet, and upon arriving, I instantly see her.
2268:I figured she'd be here since she loves books, and I was right.
2269:ShinkÅgHow are you doing today, Comet?Åh
2270:CometÅg......Åh
2271:ShinkÅgComet? Hey.Åh
2272:CometÅg.........Åh
2273:I walk over and call out to her without delay, but she keeps her head down reading without reacting to me at all.
2274:I thought maybe she was just engrossed in the book, but it doesn't look like she's turning the pages.
2275:ShinkÅgComet! Are you listening!?Åh
2276:CometÅg...! P-professor? Scared me. Surprised.Åh
2277:ShinkÅg......?Åh
2278:I try yelling at her in a louder voice. With a start, her body shakes and she looks up at me.
2279:Her voice is as monotone as usual, but I sense a trace of melancholy in there nonetheless.
2280:ShinkÅgAre you all right? It looks like you were deep in thought there.Åh
2281:CometÅgDeep in thought? Was I...? I see, guess so.Åh
2282:ShinkÅg...? What's gotten into you? Are you troubled about what happened this morning?Åh
2283:CometÅgPerhaps... I guess. It's likely that's what I think.Åh
2284:ShinkÅgThat's not very clear...Åh
2285:Is she really troubled that badly?
2286:CometÅgProfessor. May I have a few minutes of your time?Åh
2287:ShinkÅgSure, that's what I'm here for.Åh
2288:CometÅgThanks. There's something I want to ask you. I don't understand what happened this morning. I've been thinking, but can't figure it out.Åh
2289:ShinkÅgSorry, but you can phrase that in a way that makes sense to me?Åh
2290:CometÅgAll right. Let me explain in a way that even the stupid professor can understand.Åh
2291:ShinkÅgI got confused by the way you speak, but I'm fine now. So, what don't you understand?Åh
2292:CometÅgSo this morning, Rin was angry, right?Åh
2293:ShinkÅgYeah, she seemed that way.Åh
2294:CometÅgWhy was she mad? The problem was between us. No reason for her to be mad. But she was. Why?Åh
2295:ShinkÅgHuh?Åh
2296:She can't figure out why Rin got angry?
2297:CometÅgI don't have a soul, therefore I can't figure it out. I'm a doll that can't understand what everyone's thinking.Åh
FIXME êS is kind of hard to translate into English. It's mind/heart/spirit all in one. Maybe "soul" sounds best here. 
This whole conversation is insane though. óùâ covers the ideas of understanding, comprehension, appreciation, sympathy. 
She can clearly understand what she reads in books though?
2298:ShinkÅgErr, you don't have a soul?Åh
2299:CometÅgI know what you want to say. I tell jokes, I carry on conversations with people around me, therefore I must have a soul.Åh
2300:CometÅgBut that's not my soul. I simply copy what I see and use the knowledge I've learned from books.Åh
2301:CometÅgIs that my soul? No. I don't have one. I'm a mere simulacrum. Therefore, I have no capacity for realization.Åh
2302:CometÅgI want to understand. I want to have a soul. One of my very own...Åh
2303:ShinkÅg.........Åh
2304:I can't help but grimace listening to Comet's monologue.
2305:She's talking about complex issues, but I don't understand to what extent they're connected to not having a soul.
2306:I have to say something.
2307:I don't know whether I can solve her problems, but with a troubled student here, I have to lend an ear.
2308:Assuming she were human, I could probably give her some advice.
2309:ShinkÅgHey, Comet. Doesn't this mean you do have a soul though?Åh
2310:CometÅgHm? I don't. I know that better than anyone. There's no way I wouldn't know something about myself.Åh
2311:ShinkÅgso that's why you're troubled? You can't comprehend the thoughts and emotions of other people?Åh
2312:CometÅgRight. I want to understand those things. If I did, I can obtain a soul.Åh
2313:ShinkÅgBut that's a strange thing to say. No one truly understands the thoughts and feelings of others. If someone did, what species would they even be?Åh
Reeeeeally weird phrase. It's like he wants to say "they wouldn't be human" but that doesn't make sense for monsters.
2314:CometÅgBut everyone else understood why Rin was mad. I'm the only one who didn't. Because I have no soul...Åh
2315:ShinkÅgIt's all experience. From there, you can only guess. Maybe you guess right, maybe not.Åh
2316:ShinkÅgIt's something everyone has to deal with. If you don't know, ask, feel it out, and gradually learn.Åh
2317:ShinkÅgIsn't that what having a soul is all about? As soon as you worried about wanting to understand others, you proved you had one.Åh
2318:CometÅgAsk... feel it out and learn... That's a soul?Åh
Feel it out may need to be revised when I get to the sex scene. The Japanese is like "to commune with" or "to touch each other" literally. I'm guessing it comes up again. FIXME
2319:ShinkÅgThat's right. If you're that worried, tackle your problem head-on. Ask. You're simply lacking experience is all.Åh
2320:That's probably why her emotions and the inner workings of her mind are so disconnected.
2321:I imagine that's what happens when all you do is read books alone.
2322:CometÅgIs it all right if I ask you about the things I can't comprehend? I want to learn...Åh
2323:ShinkÅgSure, ask away. I'm your teacher, after all.Åh
2324:CometÅgI see. Experience. My blind spot was that I didn't realize there are things you can't learn from books.Åh
2325:CometÅgThank you, professor. I'm feeling better already. It's a strange feeling.Åh
2326:ShinkÅgI'm glad to hear it.Åh
2327:It makes me happy to see the smiling expression on Comet's face.
2328:Simply doing something that makes me feel like a real teacher is very satisfying.
2329:Although if I don't follow up on this properly, I won't be that ecstatic.
2330:ShinkÅgOkay, I've got to go. Come to class tomorrow, all right?Åh
2331:CometÅgIn order to gain experience?Åh
2332:ShinkÅgThat's right.Åh
2333:CometÅgUnderstood. I'll make sure to attend all my classes, not just yours.Åh
2334:ShinkÅgWonderful.Åh
2335:Comet's hands skillfully nod her head. I smile at her, pat her on the head, and head out of the library.
2336:I really want to head straight back to my class, but I guess I should give them a break.
2337:Anyway, it's too much to expect Comet to change overnight. It's probably going to take some time.
2338:I'm definitely glad I got to talk to her though. She speaks and acts strangely, but deep down she's just a normal girl.
2339:Well, carrying her head around in her hands might not be normal, but that's a minor detail.
2340:ShinkÅgLooks like today's almost over.Åh
2341:After my classes have ended, I take a breather on a bench in the courtyard. 
2342:I just finished talking to the other teachers, and it turns out Comet didn't show up to their classes after all.
2343:I suppose it isn't a big deal. I didn't think she was immediately going to become a new person.
2344:I'll give her some space, and she'll probably end up attending soon enough.
2345:ShinkÅgIf you're worried about something, better to solve the problem completely. You can only afford to do that when you're young.Åh
2346:PhamÅgYes, that's exactly right. It's odd to hear you say that though.Åh
I think she means to say that he's young too, but it sounded like he was excluding himself.
2347:ShinkÅgGah!? Stop showing up so unexpectedly! Are you really not following me around?Åh
2348:PhamÅgPardon me. Although now that you mention following, perhaps I am.Åh
2349:ShinkÅgSeriously!?Åh
2350:PhamÅgAh, but don't get me wrong. I'm not following you around in particular.Åh
2351:ShinkÅgUhh, whatever then. Anyway, what brings you here today?Åh
2352:PhamÅgNothing special. Just saying hello since I saw you alone. Am I bothering you?Åh
2353:ShinkÅgNo, not at all.Åh
2354:Although every time I speak with Pham, I seem to leave with more questions than answers.
2355:Plus I have to be careful about other people showing up since I'm the only one who can see and hear her.
2356:PhamÅgHuhu, even if you aren't that concerned, you should know that I didn't disappear last time simply because I thought it'd be fun.Åh
2357:ShinkÅgAre you serious...Åh
2358:PhamÅgYep. And thus, I'll disappear now. Hang in there, you've still got a long way to go.Åh
2359:ShinkÅgH-hey!Åh
2360:After our short conversation, Pham disappears like usual, fading away.
2361:What does she really want, or more importantly, who in the world is she?
2362:MiritaÅgHuh, professor? Are you all right? You're staring off into space.Åh
2363:ShinkÅgAah, Mirita? I'm fine, simply getting some fresh air.Åh
2364:MiritaÅgIs that so...? Anyway, did you get to talk to Comet?Åh
2365:ShinkÅgYeah, well, I can't tell you what we talked about.Åh
2366:MiritaÅgOh, that's fine. I just hoped she wasn't feeling depressed.Åh
2367:Hmm, so in other words she was genuinely concerned for Comet?
2368:ShinkÅgHaha, you're very kind, Mirita.Åh
2369:MiritaÅgWha, whaaat!? That's not true. It's only natural to be worried about your friends.Åh
2370:ShinkÅgSo it being natural to do means you're not kind?Åh
2371:MiritaÅgAuuu...Åh
2372:As if embarrassed by the way I casually said that, Mirita looks down at the ground and blushes.
2373:Her reaction makes me feel uncomfortable at the same time.
2374:ShinkÅgAt any rate, you don't need to worry about Comet. I heard her out, and she's going to start coming to class.Åh
2375:MiritaÅgReally? That's great.Åh
2376:ShinkÅgSo you can rest assured, okay? Hey, isn't it about time for dinner?Åh
2377:MiritaÅgAh, you're right. I'll go ahead then, professor.Åh
2378:ShinkÅgSure. See you at the dining hall.Åh
2379:I changed the subject to something less awkward. Mirita seemed to play along and then left with a strained goodbye.
2380:I'm surprised she's so concerned. Even though she's of mixed race, it's rare to find such a nice girl these days.
2381:ShinkÅgNow then, guess I should get some food myself.Åh
2382:I stand up from the bench with that in mind and begin heading to the dining hall.
2383:ShinkÅgHmm...?Åh
2384:With the rising temperature, it's gotten a bit harder to sleep through the night. Lying awake, I suddenly feel uneasy.
2385:It sounds like there's something rustling in my room. A thief, perhaps?
2386:ShinkÅgNo, I doubt it.Åh
2387:What am I thinking? There's no way a human could break in here.
2388:And I really doubt a monster a monster would specifically try to steal a human's stuff.
2389:So then what in the world is that sound?
2390:ShinkÅgWhat was that...?Åh
2391:I sit up and look around the room, but I don't see anyone.
2392:Am I imagining things, or is something hiding in here?
2393:ShinkÅgHuh, what's this...Åh
2394:Going over the possibilities in my head, I finally notice an unnatural bulge under my sheet.
2395:Was it really trying to hide itself under here?
2396:No, when I take a better look, it's not hiding, but instead crawling closer towards me like it wants to wake me up...
2397:ShinkÅgHey! What are you doing!?Åh
2398:CometÅgOops. I've been discovered.Åh
2399:ShinkÅgHuh? Comet?Åh
2400:CometÅgYep. Midnight greetings, professor.Åh
2401:Sensing danger, I throw off the sheet only to be greeted by a perfectly calm Comet.
2402:I'm so shocked by the unexpectedness of her arrival that I can't even think.
2403:CometÅgProfessor? Is something wrong? It looks like you've gone totally stiff.Åh
2404:ShinkÅgAh, no, sorry. I just spaced out there for... wait a minute! What do you think you're doing here!?Åh
2405:CometÅgNice bit of comedy, but you should keep it down. If someone comes to check out the noise, that'd be a problem, wouldn't it?Åh
2406:ShinkÅgNgh...!Åh
2407:She's right. I hurriedly shut myself up after that reflexive outburst.
2408:After having her discovered in here just this morning, two days in a row would look fishy no matter the circumstances.
2409:CometÅgHuhu, that's good. I don't want to cause a disturbance either.Åh
2410:ShinkÅgThen why did you come here? If you're found, I'm going to get in trouble again.Åh
2411:CometÅgI wanted to thank you for this afternoon, and also to give you a bit of a warning.Åh
2412:ShinkÅgA warning?Åh
2413:CometÅgThat's right. I'll show you just how incredibly defenseless you are firsthand.Åh
firsthand is literally "with my body" - obvious double entendre
2414:ShinkÅgHuh? Defenseless?Åh
2415:What's she talking about?
2416:I don't think I'm especially defenseless.
2417:CometÅgDefenseless. You leave your door unlocked and take no precautions whatsoever.Åh
2418:CometÅgI don't think you realize it, but you're a prime target.Åh
comparatively aimed at
2419:ShinkÅgMe? A target?Åh
2420:CometÅgYeah. Since you seem to insufficiently understand your circumstances, let me clue you in... We're monsters.Åh
2421:ShinkÅgI know. I appreciate that well enough.Åh
2422:Their way of life, their physical strength, their lack of human social etiquette...
2423:There's no end to the differences. Since I took this job, I've been keenly made aware of them.
2424:CometÅgThat's where you're wrong. Absolutely, totally wrong. You don't get it at all.Åh
2425:CometÅgTo put it simply, you're prey. Food. Did you think there weren't any man-eating species here?Åh
2426:ShinkÅg...!Åh
2427:Comet's revelation hits me like a hammer to the head.
2428:I had thought of plenty of ways a human could get in trouble here, but that one never crossed my mind.
2429:CometÅgWell, don't be too alarmed. You should be all right as long as you lock the door.Åh
2430:ShinkÅgR-really?Åh
2431:CometÅgYour room is able to prevent intruders. You activate a device by locking the door. It's probably made with monster science.Åh
2432:ShinkÅgI see...Åh
2433:Did the academy assume something that dangerous could happen to me?
2434:It makes me feel safe for now, but in the future I'd like to build a relationship of trust such that I don't have to rely on this.
2435:ShinkÅgThanks for the warning. Was that your way of thanking me? If so, you'd better head back to your room.Åh
2436:CometÅgWhat are you talking about? That little warning isn't part of my gratitude.Åh
2437:CometÅgThat's something... you're going to enjoy a lot more.Åh
2438:ShinkÅgSomething I'm going to... enjoy? Hey, what are you doing!?Åh
2439:Right as I express doubt about the meaning of Comet's words, I feel a soft sensation crawling up my leg.
2440:Now that I think about it, I've had an uneasy feeling for awhile now. Just what the hell is she planning to do?
2441:CometÅgHuhu, you already know. Playing dumb is hardly romantic.Åh
Playing dumb shows you don't understand the delicacies in love between man and woman
2442:ShinkÅgNo, no! I have no idea what you're up to!Åh
2443:CometÅgOh, I forgot to mention it. There are lots of men who look forward to doing this. So pay attention.Åh
2444:ShinkÅgCome again?Åh
2445:CometÅgSemen is an important source of nutrition for monsters. Myself included.Åh
2446:ShinkÅgAll right, but why now!?Åh
2447:CometÅgKuku, I'm beating the others to the punch. I have a feeling I'll be too late if I don't act now.Åh
2448:CometÅgBesides, it must be hard being the only male teacher. I can get high-quality nutrition, and you'll feel refreshed. It'll be perfect.Åh
2449:ShinkÅgThis won't be perfect at all! Come on, let me go!Åh
2450:CometÅgThe answer is no. Please accept my gratitude, professor... Huhu.Åh
2451:ShinkÅgWait... Wha!?Åh
2452:In a panic, I try to get away, but Comet's body pins me down so that I can't move.
2453:CometÅgHmm, so this is a penis? It's the first time I've seen one for real. Very interesting.Åh
2454:CometÅgHowever, it's a different shape than the ones I've seen in books. Why is that?Åh
2455:ShinkÅgComet, don't do this. Please get off me.Åh
2456:I speak to Comet, hoping to get her to dismount from my waist.
2457:Nevertheless, she's completely fixated on my penis and isn't listening.
2458:CometÅgHmm, this is a good opportunity to try what I've read about. This is surely a blessing from Heaven.Åh
Sounds weird, but doesn't translate to anything else.
2459:ShinkÅgKuh, that's enough... Let me go.Åh
2460:CometÅgBe quiet, professor. This is more important right now. Ah, the semen comes out from here.Åh
2461:CometÅgNext, I do this...Åh
2462:CometÅgAh, chp... mmmsspst...Åh
2463:ShinkÅgKuhh!Åh
2464:Comet turns her head around in the opposite direction from normal, brings it close to my penis, and sticks out her tongue.
2465:Perhaps because it's made of a different material than her doll body, her tongue feels sticky coiled around me instead of rough.
2466:That sticky feeling licks my penis, causing my hips to reflexively lurch upwards.
2467:CometÅgHmm, ummchp, sspst... It doesn't look like you've ever felt... anything like my tongue before.Åh
2468:CometÅgNeither humans... nor monsters... can easily replicate it...Åh
2469:ShinkÅgGah, what is this sensation... haaa!Åh
2470:Each time Comet's tongue licks up and down my shaft, a melting sensation wraps around it.
2471:The sensation remains even after her tongue moves on, making it feel like my entire penis is being licked at once.
2472:CometÅgMmchp, I'm getting a bit of a reaction... How about if I do this...Åh
2473:CometÅgMmm, it's getting warmer now... And leaping up with force too.Åh
2474:ShinkÅgKuh, haaa...Åh
2475:I halfway rise to my feet and let out a moan from these new, strange feelings.
2476:There's no way any human could withstand this persistent, sticky stimulation. Disgracefully, I get an erection for Comet.
2477:CometÅgMmmpch, chp... Oooh, ngh... Just like what I saw in the book...Åh
2478:CometÅgIf I stimulate it like this, semen will come out. Very, very interesting.Åh
2479:ShinkÅgComet... That's a really bad idea...Åh
2480:I desperately try to resist her tongue's sticky licking, but my penis is showing no signs of compliance.
2481:More pressing, the stimulating sensation intensifies with each new layer of saliva, taking my consciousness away with it.
2482:ShinkÅgKuhaaa... Why is this so good... Ngh!Åh
2483:CometÅgSpecial materials... Very hard to obtain...Åh
2484:CometÅgOnce it comes into contact with you, the sensation lasts for a short while. Indeed, if I move on to here...Åh
2485:Comet stares at my manhood with an expression of great interest and licks various spots as if to check my reaction.
2486:While licking my shaft up and down, she sometimes shifts horizontally too.
2487:It's like she's figuring out how each area responds differently.
2488:CometÅgMmmpch, mmn... Very interesting... Depending on where I lick...Åh
2489:CometÅgYour penis reacts differently... Mmmpch, mmmngh...Åh
2490:CometÅgHuaa, aaah... This requires more thorough investigation.Åh
2491:Her expression completely changes from one of curiosity to seriousness as she continues to lick my penis.
2492:She gazes at it in observation as it leaps up and trembles under her tongue.
2493:CometÅgMmmpch, sspst, aah... It's gotten a lot bigger than before... and smells stronger too...Åh
2494:CometÅgSome juice is... coming out of the tip... mmmsspst...Åh
2495:CometÅgIf this is coming out, your ejaculation shouldn't be far behind...Åh
2496:ShinkÅgUgh, haaa... Stop...Åh
2497:Her running commentary as the sensation of her tongue coils around my entire penis fills me with shame.
2498:Keenly aware of that, precum steadily flows out, and I feel a torrent of semen gradually rising from my depths.
2499:ShinkÅgKuh, haaa... Can't take... any more...Åh
2500:CometÅgYour penis is bulging... Mmmngh, oooh, sspst...Åh
2501:CometÅgSomething is... climbing... preparing to gush out...Åh
2502:CometÅgThis is... a sign you're going to ejaculate... Come for me, professor.Åh
2503:ShinkÅgKuhaaaa...! Aaah!!Åh
2504:The sensation of her tongue forces me to come in the blink of an eye. Dazed, I watch my semen fly out.
2505:It powerfully spews forth, landing all over Comet's face, but she doesn't seem to mind.
2506:CometÅgSo this is an ejaculation... What an amazing smell and quantity. There's much more than the book said.Åh
2507:CometÅgNgh, haa... This hole at the end of your penis where it came out is all sticky. It feels kind of weird.Åh
2508:ShinkÅgUgh, aaah...Åh
2509:Listening to her calm observations makes me so embarrassed that I want to run away.
2510:However, Comet isn't going to allow that. All I can do is sit here with my genitals exposed to her.
2511:CometÅgMmpch, ahh... Mmmngh, mmmmn...Åh
2512:CometÅgThe taste isn't bad... I know why you have everyone's attention now...Åh
2513:ShinkÅg...ugh.Åh
2514:Comet looks lost in ecstasy as she laps up the semen that fell on her face.
2515:Watching her tongue move around and listening to her voice turns me on even more, sending blood into my cock.
2516:CometÅgMmmpch, sspst, mmn... Your penis is still so big...Åh
2517:CometÅgYou can come more then... But this time, I'm going to get closer.Åh
2518:ShinkÅgKuh, what are...!Åh
2519:Enthralled staring at my erect manhood, Comet's hands bring her head in between my legs.
2520:Once she's close enough, she lines it up and swallows my entire cock into her mouth.
2521:CometÅgPch, mmmngh, ssspst... Mmmnn!Åh
2522:ShinkÅgKuhaaaa!Åh
2523:Snugly between her lips and tongue, I can feel Comet all over me.
2524:Just like earlier, her sticky tongue licks my glans, and the artificial, soft feeling of her cheeks press against my shaft.
2525:The inhuman sensation causes my hips to buck and my penis to rage violently inside of her mouth.
2526:CometÅgMmmn! Sspsst, gaaah... It's all the way... to the back of my throat...Åh
2527:CometÅgThis actually does... hurt a bit, but...Åh
2528:CometÅgThe taste your penis... is spreading... Spreading all throughout my mouth... Mmmn, sspst!Åh
2529:ShinkÅgAaah, Comet, stop... If you suck on me that hard...!Åh
2530:Since the sensation lingers with each touch of her tongue, this feels like being licked by an uncountable number of them.
2531:CometÅgThen just come for me... Here, let me help...Åh
2532:Ignoring my pleas to stop, Comet raises her head and intensely bobs back and forth trying to get me to ejaculate.
2533:ShinkÅgKuh, aaah!Åh
2534:Her lips purse, stroking my shaft as her tongue crawls over my glans, making my waist burn with pleasure and melting my resistance.
2535:My penis trembles in joy from the sensations inside Comet's mouth, and I feel semen beginning its ascent.
2536:CometÅgMmmpch, mmmchp, mmmngh... Aaah, it's overflowing from your penis...!Åh
2537:CometÅgWhen I tighten my lips like this... it really shakes around...!Åh
2538:CometÅgI can taste you... with every taste bud in my mouth.Åh
2539:ShinkÅgKuh, haaaa... That's too much!Åh
2540:Without showing any mercy, Comet continues furiously moving her head.
2541:Each time my tip hits the back of her throat, I can feel it pressing against a smooth hardness.
2542:The pain of hitting that hard wall mixes with the pleasure, and I feel a whirlpool of desire churning between my legs.
2543:CometÅgMmmnn, aaaah, sspsst... This is delicious. Give me more!Åh
2544:CometÅgCome... Shoot lots of semen inside me!Åh
2545:ShinkÅgUgh, aaah... Can't hold on... Coming!Åh
2546:CometÅgNnngh, mmm, ssspst, mmmpch, spppst!Åh
2547:CometÅgMmmnghgh, aaaah, oooh, aaaah...Åh
2548:With my entire cock being vigorously sucked, I reach a second climax all too quickly.
2549:Comet's mouth soaks up every drop while I'm stunned with an entranced expression on my face.
2550:CometÅgMmmn, sspst... Aaah, delicious. Almost addictive...Åh
2551:CometÅgEven if I keep sucking... I can't absorb this much...Åh
2552:ShinkÅgGuh, aaah, if you keep talking with me in your mouth...!Åh
2553:I can feel all the semen collecting in Comet's mouth as my long ejaculation finally ends.
2554:CometÅgMmmpchaa... Your penis returned to normal, but there more things I wanted to try out. Oh well...Åh
2555:CometÅgYour semen is really good though... but I can't handle this much of it.Åh
2556:ShinkÅgHaa, haaa...Åh
2557:Comet stares at me with a broad grin, her cheeks bloated with my cum.
2558:I've got a bad feeling about what's going to happen next, but I'm too drained after coming to do anything but watch.
2559:CometÅgMmmpch, it's a bit of a waste, but I'll return it to its owner.Åh
lmao
2560:ShinkÅgWha...!?Åh
2561:Comet adjusts the position of her head. With her mouth closed, my semen pours out of her throat.
2562:As it sloshes all over my penis, Comet watches with an entertained smile on her face.
2563:CometÅgHuhu, it looks like you peed your pants, professor. That suits you quite well.Åh
2564:ShinkÅgHow in the hell does this suit me...Åh
2565:CometÅgThis was a very worthwhile use of my time. See you later.Åh
2566:ShinkÅg......Åh
2567:Comet laughs radiantly. I try to offer some kind of objection, but...
2568:Exhausted from ejaculation, all I do is sigh, unable to say anything.
2569:ShinkÅgSeriously, why did you do that all of a sudden...Åh
2570:CometÅgThat was a sure way to express gratitude. At least that's the conclusion I came to... Was I wrong?Åh
2571:ShinkÅgUgh...Åh
2572:When she puts it that way, I can't get mad at her...
2573:The manner in which she did it doesn't change the fact that it was for my benefit, I guess.
Bleh, too many "its"
2574:ShinkÅgYou weren't wrong, but from now on, it'd be nice if you'd consider my feelings too...Åh
give me a bit more thought/consideration or some such
2575:CometÅgHmm, really? Okay. When we touch each other next time, I'll try my best to understand you.Åh
Loads of terrible sentences. "touch each other" is probably too literal
2576:ShinkÅg...I see. Please do.Åh
2577:CometÅgAnyway, I need to leave. Other people will probably get mad if they find me here in the morning again.Åh
2578:ShinkÅgYeah, see you tomorrow.Åh
2579:CometÅgGood night.Åh
2580:Comet bids me good night with an innocent look and leaves my room.
2581:Was it just my imagination, or did she look strangely pleased...
2582:ShinkÅgHaa...Åh
2583:I'm glad to be getting along well with her, but this could end up going very poorly.
2584:Well, I warned her so hopefully she won't overdo it to that extent anymore.
Bleh
2585:With all of that weighing on my mind, I flop my worn out body back down onto the bed and fall asleep.
2586:ShinkÅgAll right, class time everyone.Åh
2587:Student 1ÅgOkay...Åh
2588:Student 2ÅgHey, professor, you're looking kinda tired today.Åh
2589:ShinkÅgHuh? No, I'm fine. No more tired than usual, anyway.Åh
2590:Student 1ÅgAww. I was hoping you'd take the day off so we could just study on our own.Åh
2591:ShinkÅgSettle down, that's not happening.Åh
2592:Student 2ÅgAhaha, denied.Åh
2593:The morning after Comet's midnight raid, I walk up to the lectern to begin class as usual.
2594:It doesn't look like she's here though. I guess it'll be awhile before she'll take classes seriously.
2595:CometÅgSorry I'm late.Åh
2596:ShinkÅgWhoa!? Comet!?Åh
2597:CometÅgHi. I'd appreciate it if you didn't mark me late, okay?Åh
2598:ShinkÅgHmm, fine, close enough I suppose.Åh
2599:With a strained smile, I mark Comet present on the attendance roster.
2600:Truthfully she was late, but she did make the effort to come. I can let her slide this time.
2601:CometÅgThank you, thank you. Oh, I almost forgot something important.Åh
2602:ShinkÅgHuh? Something important?Åh
2603:CometÅgYes. Heading them off for the time being with a declaration.Åh
Super hard to translate sentence. String of nouns that don't translate well. "Heading them off" same word as "beating them to the punch" used earlier. Literally means "check, restraint"
2604:ShinkÅgDeclaration?Åh
2605:CometÅgYes, if I don't make it today, it feels like I might be too late.Åh
2606:RinÅgEh...? W-why are you glaring at me?Åh
2607:MiritaÅgH-huh? Is she staring at me too?Åh
2608:ShinkÅgHey what's going on... Com-oof!?Åh
2609:As the mood in the classroom takes a turn towards unrest, Comet approaches me and latches onto my arm.
Bleh
2610:Caught off guard by her sudden move, I'm completely at her mercy.
2611:RinÅgHey! What do you think you're doing, Comet!?Åh
2612:CometÅgThis is why I'm making my move. Hmm, just Rin? That's convenient.Åh
2613:ShinkÅgH-hey... Comet?Åh
2614:CometÅgPlease be quiet for a minute, professor. Ahem...Åh
2615:CometÅgLet it be known. The professor is mine. From now on, keep your hands off him without my permission.Åh
2616:ShinkÅgWhaaa!?Åh
2617:I was already nervous about what she was going to say, but now I'm left staring with my mouth hanging open.
2618:Like the rest of the class, I can feel that things are about to get ugly.
2619:Why in the hell did she have to suddenly announce that!?
2620:ShinkÅgHold on, Comet! This is too...Åh
2621:RinÅgWh-wh-what's going on!? Professor Shink, explain yourself!Åh
2622:ShinkÅgI have no idea! It's not my fault!Åh
2623:CometÅgI can't believe it. After all the love you showed me... Woe is me.Åh
2624:ShinkÅgWait wait wait!Åh
2625:What is this damn girl going to tell everyone!!
2626:RinÅgL-love!? Professor Shink, what in the world did you do with Comet!?Åh
2627:BibiÅgWow, really. Way to go, professor!Åh
2628:MiritaÅgHueee!? Love... no, no way... Aaaah!?Åh
2629:ShireneÅgHow dirty! This is why humans...!!Åh
2630:ShinkÅgWait! Hold on! It's all a misunderstanding! Stop saying crazy things, Comet!Åh
2631:CometÅgIt's the truth though. Anyway, please keep your hands off him without my permission. Thank you.Åh
2632:Shink
2633:ÅgNo thank you!Åh
2634:What can I do!? This is going to be a disaster!!
2635:RinÅgWhy are you telling us this, Comet! I don't understand!Åh
2636:MiritaÅgYeah, me neither. Plus it's rather rude to treat the professor like an object you can own!Åh
2637:CometÅgOh, it's just an expression. It's not like I'm treating him as an object.Åh
God this took me forever to figure out. Mirita refers to 2614 "Professor is my thing." I edited 2634 so hopefully 2635 makes sense literally.
2638:RinÅgThat's still wrong! I won't allow it!Åh
2639:CometÅgWhy do I need your permission? Isn't this between the professor and I?Åh
2640:RinÅgW-well...Åh
2641:ShinkÅgErrr, the way I see it...Åh
2642:BibiÅgHahaha, the professor's such a pimp.Åh
sexy, popular, well-liked
2643:ShireneÅgWhatever. I came here to learn.Åh
2644:Student 1ÅgOoh, now things have gotten interesting.Åh
2645:Student 2ÅgSure have. Is he really that handsome of a man? I'm not sure.Åh
2646:ShinkÅgSo now what...Åh
2647:CometÅgAnyway, that's all I wanted to say. You can start class now.Åh
2648:RinÅgHold on! I'm not done talking with you!Åh
2649:ShinkÅgHow am I supposed to teach a class like this?Åh
2650:The room has descended into chaos. Not only am I not teaching, but...
2651:KyuteÅgQuiet down! We can hear you next door!Åh
2652:ShinkÅgUngh... K-kyute...Åh
2653:KyuteÅgShink! You're the teacher, do something about this noise! Get your class under control!Åh
2654:ShinkÅgWell, that's kind of hard...Åh
2655:Nonetheless, I have to do something.
2656:Being a teacher is difficult. Extremely so.
2657:CometÅgHuhu, good luck.Åh
2658:ShinkÅg.........Åh
2659:Seeing Comet's rather upbeat smile just makes me sigh.
2660:This is a tough situation, but oh well. It comes with the job, I guess.
2661:After convincing myself of that, I walk over to noisy students and yell.
2662:ShinkÅgSigh...Åh
2663:I fully stretch out my arms, basking in the sunlight.
2664:I'm getting pretty hot out here since the temperature has been rising with the changing of the season.
2665:It's unpleasant to think about it becoming any hotter, but I wonder if the students agree.
2666:ShinkÅgHuh? Is that...Åh
2667:ShireneÅgSeiyaaa!!Åh
2668:It's still early in the morning, but as I casually look around, I see Shirene energetically swinging a pole around.
2669:No matter how many swings I watch, they're all magnificent.
2670:ShireneÅgUgh, not done yet!Åh
2671:ShinkÅgHmmm.Åh
2672:It looks like she's going through basic movements. Thrust, down swing, up swing, horizontal slash. I can tell she's well-trained.
2673:ShireneÅgMngh, who's there!Åh
2674:ShinkÅgSorry, did I interrupt?Åh
2675:ShireneÅgOh, it's you. Is there something you need from me? I don't like being stared at.Åh
2676:ShinkÅgUgh...Åh
2677:I unconsciously step back and look down at the ground to avoid her piercing gaze.
2678:Perhaps because she still doesn't like me, it vaguely feels like the tension between us is rising.
2679:ShireneÅgIf you don't have a reason to be here, get out of my sight. You disgust me.Åh
2680:ShinkÅgUhh, sorry then. I'll leave you alone.Åh
2681:I think I've bonded with all the other girls in some way. Only Shirene's attitude remains unchanged.
2682:Even if I try to start a conversation, she won't talk to me because I'm human. All I get are greetings and curt replies.
2683:I thought I could solve the problem with time, but I haven't seen any progress with her.
2684:What I need is some kind of chance to open things up... Speaking of which, I don't feel that close to Bibi either.
2685:Those two are the exceptions in the class. I'd like to do something about it, but...
2686:ShireneÅgHaa!Åh
2687:ShinkÅgHaa...Åh
2688:Shirene ignores me and returns to practice. Sighing, I leave her to herself.
2689:RinÅgProfessor Shiiink, want to eat together?Åh
2690:ShinkÅgSure.Åh
2691:As if she were keeping an eye out for me, Rin invites me to her table as soon as I get my food.
2692:I sit down on the nearest chair, place my plate down in front of me, and start eating.
2693:CometÅgHmm, special B? A safe choice. You always seem to eat that lately, professor.Åh
2694:ShinkÅgWhoa!? Comet! Stop doing that! How long have you been sitting beside me?Åh
2695:CometÅgI wonder. Ah, I'll take that, please. *Munch*Åh
2696:ShinkÅgTch, hey!? You took the main dish, of all things!Åh
2697:I had even started eating on it already!
2698:CometÅgDon't worry, I'll give you this in exchange.Åh
2699:ShinkÅgNo, you can keep it. Don't give me something half-eaten...Åh
2700:CometÅgIt's like the professor and I are indirectly... Hehe.Åh
2701:RinÅgNo, stop! That's rude, Comet! Here professor, have this instead! You mustn't eat that!Åh
2702:ShinkÅgUhh, wait a second...Åh
2703:In reaction to what Comet said, Rin hurriedly snatches a side dish off my plate and replaces it with one of her own.
2704:However...
2705:ShinkÅgThis is half-eaten too, you know.Åh
2706:CometÅgTch, a minor setback. I'd like you to back off a bit.Åh
2707:RinÅgThat should be my line! Don't you think you're getting carried away recently, Comet?Åh
2708:CometÅgI'm acting perfectly natural, not getting carried away at all. You're the one who should have more restraint.Åh
2709:ShinkÅg...haa.Åh
2710:They're both at fault. While it's nice to have them emotionally attached, it's going to be depressing if this happens every day.
2711:MiritaÅgAh, ahaha... Always having problems, I see.Åh
2712:ShinkÅgYeah. Hey, Mirita, could you bail me out of this one?Åh
2713:MiritaÅgUmmm, I'll pass. If I get between them, it's only going to complicate things.Åh
2714:ShinkÅgYeah, you're probably right.Åh
2715:KyuteÅgExactly. Besides, since they both adore you so dearly, one shouldn't put obstacles in their way.Åh
Too literal perhaps
2716:ShinkÅgI understand that, but...Åh
2717:Perhaps because our usual arguing attracts attention, Mirita and Kyute come over with smirks on their faces.
2718:They both sit down with us and begin eating.
2719:Naturally, neither seems to have any desire to interfere on my behalf.
2720:RinÅgGrrrrrrrrr!Åh
2721:CometÅg......tch.Åh
2722:ShinkÅgStop threatening each other across the table. No lip smacking or tongue clicking either.Åh
2723:KyuteÅgHehe, it's so cute to see them fighting over you. I'm glad to see everyone in your class is opening up to you.Åh
2724:ShinkÅgHow can you think that from looking at this...Åh
Bleh, also FIXME Shink then says ëÂï®Ç≈Ç∑ÇÀ. What the hell does that mean here?
2725:Besides, it's not like everyone in the class is opening up to me.
2726:There's Shirene, and Shirene...
Maybe that second Shirene was supposed to be Bibi? Goof by the writer or a joke?
2727:ShinkÅgHaa...Åh
2728:MiritaÅgHm? Is something wrong, professor?Åh
2729:ShinkÅgNo, well... I'm not sure things are going so smoothly.Åh
2730:MiritaÅgAh, you mean Shirene?Åh
2731:KyuteÅgMm? Are you having problems with Shirene?Åh
2732:ShinkÅgYou've seen the way she talks to me, right?Åh
2733:KyuteÅgWell, yeah. But there's nothing you can do about that.Åh
2734:ShinkÅgI was kinda getting that feeling too, but I think if I can just get an opportunity...Åh
2735:KyuteÅgHmmm, an opportunity...Åh
2736:Kyute and I both stop eating and take time to ponder out loud.
2737:Any kind of chance to get close to Shirene would be great, no matter how trivial, but nothing comes to mind.
2738:RinÅgNngh... Professor Shink, are you interested in Shirene now too!?Åh
2739:ShinkÅgWhoa, why'd you jump to that conclusion?Åh
2740:CometÅgHer heart? She's following her heart, right?Åh
2741:ShinkÅgThat's not what's going on...Åh
2742:MiritaÅgAh, that reminds me... I got a message that she was returning soon.Åh
2743:ShinkÅgWho's returning?Åh
2744:I'm still in shock from Rin and Comet's accusations when Mirita claps her hands and turns towards us as if remembering something.
2745:Someone who left is now coming back, or something?
2746:KyuteÅgOh, she finally got in touch? Honestly, why is she always so spontaneous?Åh
2747:ShinkÅgUmm, Kyute? Who are we talking about?Åh
2748:KyuteÅgAah, you know how there's one more girl in your class who never shows up?Åh
2749:ShinkÅg...yeah, there is.Åh
2750:I had completely forgotten until now, but there is a student who hasn't attended class since I started here.
2751:If I remember correctly, her name is...
2752:ShinkÅgVera M. Den... right?Åh
2753:MiritaÅgYep. She sent me a message that she'll be back at the academy soon.Åh
2754:ShinkÅgWas she studying abroad or something?Åh
2755:CometÅgDoubt it. She was probably doing what she usually does.Åh
2756:RinÅgYeah, this is normal for her... although this time was a bit longer than most.Åh
2757:ShinkÅg......???Åh
2758:They all force themselves to smile as if they're in on some kind of joke.
2759:I'm not quite sure what they're talking about, but I get a bad feeling anyway.
2760:KyuteÅgShe'll show up to class eventually, and then you'll understand. She's an amazing girl in lots of ways.Åh
2761:ShinkÅgIs that so?Åh
2762:RinÅgShe's a good person though, just a bit rambunctious.Åh
I think that's the first time I've used that word in my life, but it fits!
2763:CometÅgNot just a bit. She's insanely noisy.Åh
2764:MiritaÅgAhahahaha...Åh
2765:Their description honestly makes me uneasy, and it also doesn't seem like I'm going to get that chance to befriend Shirene and Bibi.
2766:RinÅgAh, Shirene!Åh
2767:ShireneÅgRin? What's up... Oh, you're here too.Åh
2768:ShinkÅgYeah, hi...Åh
2769:RinÅgCut that out. Don't take that kind of attitude with Professor Shink.Åh
2770:ShireneÅgSee here, Rin. I've told you countless times, I'm not interested in being friends with humans.Åh
2771:ShireneÅgI don't know what you see in this one, but I'm not getting pulled into it with you.Åh
2772:RinÅgWait! Shirene!Åh
2773:Shirene stomps off towards a table on the other side of the room, ignoring Rin's shouting.
2774:I'm never going to be able to approach her directly, am I?
2775:CometÅgHer attitude is getting worse. Should I go comfort her?Åh
2776:ShinkÅgIt'll only make you miserable.Åh
éSÇﬂÇ…Ç»ÇÈÇ©ÇÁó«Ç¢ ??? "Because becomes miserable, good"
2777:CometÅgThat's irritating.Åh
2778:RinÅgSigh, she can't help it though.Åh
2779:Rin looks over at Shirene and puffs her cheeks out in a show of disappointment.
2780:Seeing Rin like that makes me understand that I really need to do something sooner rather than later.
2781:ShinkÅgAll right, please read this part next.Åh
2782:As I conduct class as normal, my mind wanders towards the students like Shirene that I haven't been able to connect with.
2783:As much as I want to fix the situation, I can't come up with any ideas that might work out.
2784:She comes to class, but if I try to have a conversation, she just brushes me off.
2785:I'm headed off at every turn, unable to progress.
2786:RinÅg...ink, Professor Shink!Åh
2787:ShinkÅgHu-huh? What's wrong?Åh
2788:RinÅgNothing's wrong, but we're done reading.Åh
2789:ShinkÅgOh, sorry about that.Åh
2790:Damn. I was so engrossed in my own thoughts that I wasn't paying any attention.
2791:I'll have to think about this later and concentrate on class for the time being.
2792:ShireneÅgHonestly. I wish you'd get it together.Åh
2793:ShinkÅgUgh, fair enough.Åh
2794:BibiÅgZzzzzzzÅh
2795:MiritaÅgBi-Bibi, don't sleep in class. Come on, wake up.Åh
2796:CometÅgJust leave her like that. She won't wake up unless something big happens.Åh
2797:Student 1ÅgAaah, Bibi looks so beautiful when she's asleep.Åh
2798:ShinkÅg......Åh
2799:This isn't good. The class is slowly beginning to drift off and lose focus.
2800:There are times when lessons are boring, but it's pretty obvious I'm not doing this one any favors. 
2801:ShinkÅgAll right, then next up...Åh
2802:Vera
2803:ÅgAh, hahahaha!Åh
2804:ShinkÅgWhat the...!?Åh
2805:ShireneÅgThat voice... It can't be!Åh
2806:At the same time I pull myself together and resume teaching, a laughing voice echos through the classroom.
2807:I immediately look to the door in reaction, but there's no one there.
2808:Where in the world did that come from?
2809:ShireneÅgI see you're giving us another ludicrous entrance, Vera.Åh
2810:ShinkÅgHuh? Wait, what!?Åh
2811:VeraÅgSorry to keep you waiting! Vera M. Den has finally arrived!Åh
2812:My eyes follow where Shirene is looking. Propped up in a tall window by her legs is a young girl, broadly grinning.
2813:Hold on, we're not on the ground floor. Is she sticking to the wall!?
2814:RinÅgVe-Vera!?Åh
2815:MiritaÅgThat's dangerous! Hurry up and get inside...Åh
2816:VeraÅgAhaha, dangerous? Not at all! No problem!Åh
2817:BibiÅgUnngh, what's all that racket... Oh, if it isn't Vera. So you're back, huh?Åh
2818:VeraÅgYep! After several months of training, I have returned, even more powerful than ever!!Åh
2819:ShinkÅgTraining, really...Åh
2820:This is all so sudden that I'm not following along too well. Anyway, first things first...
2821:ShinkÅgHow about coming into the classroom? You're going to give me a heart attack like that.Åh
2822:VeraÅgUmm? Huh? That's a human. Why's a human here?Åh
2823:ShinkÅgBecause I'm a teacher. We can discuss that later, just get inside!Åh
2824:VeraÅgWhy?Åh
2825:ShinkÅgBecause I'm telling you it's dangerous!Åh
2826:VeraÅgSigh... You don't get it. You really don't. You must be an idiot.Åh
2827:ShinkÅgWhy the hell is that!?Åh
2828:In reaction to my concern, the girl introduced as Vera shrugs her shoulders in complete astonishment.
2829:In fact, she seems upset that I'd even suggest she's in danger.
2830:BibiÅgHahaha, give it up, professor. You'll never get through to her. Vera lives by her own principles of common sense.Åh
2831:ShinkÅgEh...Åh
2832:It sounds like she's quite the rebel.
2833:VeraÅgHuuu, that's my Bibi! I can always count on you to understand me.Åh
2834:ShinkÅgThat really isn't something you can brag about, is it?Åh
2835:VeraÅgTch, tch, tch. It's allowed when you're as great as me. The whole world agrees!Åh
2836:ShinkÅg.........Åh
2837:What's with this girl? Does she have a few screws loose?
2838:Her insane outbursts make Comet sound perfectly normal.
2839:CometÅgHow rude. Don't even compare me to her.Åh
2840:ShinkÅg...don't read my mind.Åh
2841:RinÅgHmm, I think they're both the same.Åh
2842:MiritaÅgAgreed.Åh
2843:CometÅgOoh, I've been betrayed. How unexpected.Åh
2844:VeraÅgAhahaha! You girls are always so funny! That's exactly what I expect from my classmates!Åh
2845:ShinkÅg.........Åh
2846:The adage "birds of a feather flock together" comes to mind, but I think I'd better keep my mouth shut.
2847:VeraÅgWell then, we can't keep this up forever. Not when it looks like there's someone waiting on me.Åh
2848:ShireneÅgNnngh...!Åh
2849:VeraÅgOoh, what a wonderful thirst for blood. Hehe, I'm so excited... Hiyaa!Åh
2850:VeraÅgAll right. Hehe... is it okay if I look forward to how much stronger you've become?Åh
Too literal? Seems like an awkward thing to say even in Japanese
2851:ShireneÅgHmph, your attitude hasn't changed one bit. I'm going to wipe that smirk off your face!!Åh
2852:ShinkÅgUmm, what's going on here?Åh
2853:I'm glad that Vera finally jumped down into the classroom, but the air has gotten heavy in here all of a sudden.
2854:RinÅgErrr, Professor Shink? You'd better stand back.Åh
2855:ShinkÅgHuh?Åh
2856:CometÅgYou'll get caught between them.Åh
2857:ShinkÅgCaught between them?Åh
2858:BibiÅgWatch and see. Look, it's starting.Åh
2859:Right as Bibi finishes speaking, Vera and Shirene glare at each other, sparks flying between them.
2860:No, looking closer, is Shirene the only one glaring?
2861:ShireneÅgNgh, haaaaa!!Åh
2862:ShinkÅgWhaaaa!?Åh
2863:Given the stormy atmosphere, I was expecting something to happen, but that was unexpected.
2864:Shirene suddenly had a pole as if she pulled it from thin air then attacked Vera.
2865:VeraÅgToo easy. Come on, you can do better than that.Åh
2866:ShireneÅgKuh, don't underestimate me! Eat this!!Åh
2867:VeraÅgOoh, very nice. You've gotten a lot faster than before, haven't you? Not as good as me, though.Åh
2868:Without pausing for a moment, Shirene swings her pole from all sides so quickly I can barely follow the blows.
2869:However, Vera's octopus-like legs work together to block every swing with plenty of time to spare.
2870:ShireneÅgI'm not done! Take this!!Åh
2871:VeraÅgYo, ho! Yeah, your speed and agility have definitely improved, but still lacking I think.Åh
2872:ShireneÅgYou aren't taking this seriously enough!!Åh
2873:Determined, Shirene piles on the blows, but not a single one is actually striking Vera.
2874:It even looks like she's using fewer and fewer legs to defend herself.
2875:ShinkÅgDamn, this isn't the time to gawk.Åh
2876:I can't just let them fight in the middle of class, after all. I've got to do something to stop them.
2877:RinÅgUmm, Professor Shink, I wouldn't get near them if I were you.Åh
2878:MiritaÅgYeah, you could end up as collateral damage.Åh
2879:ShinkÅgI know, but...Åh
2880:CometÅgJust leave them alone. It'll be over in a second.Åh
2881:ShinkÅgHuh?Åh
2882:BibiÅgIndeed. I thought she had improved her skill a lot, but not enough to scratch Vera in the end, it looks like.Åh
2883:ShinkÅgAh...Åh
2884:As my students restrain me from butting in, I see what Comet and Bibi are talking about.
2885:Shirene's attacks are definitely quick and agile. With my physical ability, I'd be hard pressed just to keep up.
2886:However, are they unavoidable? Not at all.
2887:It's like all of her moves are telegraphed, and Shirene doesn't seem to be aware of it.
2888:ShireneÅgUgh, why... Why can't I hit you!Åh
2889:VeraÅgSigh. Will you give up now? I'm tired of this.Åh
2890:ShireneÅgNgh, as if I would ever stop halfway!!Åh
2891:VeraÅgIt's useless no matter how much you try. Don't you see?Åh
2892:ShireneÅgShut up! Haaaa!!Åh
2893:Vera probably doesn't mean to, but her attitude is doing nothing but provoking Shirene further.
2894:Irritated and angry, Shirene steps forward and slashes with her full strength.
2895:VeraÅgYou leave me no choice then... Hoi!Åh
2896:ShireneÅgAaah!?Åh
2897:With an indifferent sigh, Vera knocks Shirene's weapon right out of her hands.
2898:Shirene stands frozen and wide-eyed, shocked that she was disarmed so easily.
2899:VeraÅgAhahaha! That won't work! You'll never hit me like that!Åh
2900:ShireneÅgHow... This isn't possible...Åh
2901:VeraÅgYou're still too weak. If you want to beat me, you'll have to devote yourself to training harder!Åh
2902:ShireneÅgNo way... After all the work I put in...Åh
2903:ShinkÅg......Åh
2904:Shirene collapses to the floor dumbfounded as if she isn't even listening to Vera's cheer of victory.
2905:VeraÅgAll right! Haven't seen everyone in awhile!Åh
2906:BibiÅgYeah. I never doubted you'd be back, though. So where'd you go this time?Åh
2907:VeraÅgOf course I'd be fine! And I went to the sea! The sea!Åh
2908:RinÅgYou never change, do you... By any chance did you visit one of the seven seas again?Åh
2909:VeraÅgYou can't expect me to go that far. I just knocked around the local pirates who've been acting high and mighty.Åh
2910:MiritaÅgAnother dangerous adventure... Isn't your family worried about you?Åh
2911:VeraÅgWhat are you talking about? There's no way my parents would worry about me! They know I'm amazing!Åh
2912:ShinkÅg.........Åh
2913:She's telling an absolutely outrageous story, but I think she's serious.
2914:The class is looking at her as if this is perfectly normal, and I don't get the feeling she's lying.
2915:ShireneÅgUgh, why am I...Åh
2916:ShinkÅgShirene? Are you all right?Åh
2917:Unable to participate in the conversation with Vera, I turn my attention to Shirene who still appears shocked.
2918:ShireneÅgIt's none of your concern. Leave me alone.Åh
2919:However, she gives me an intense look that says she isn't interested in talking about it.
2920:Surprisingly, I don't feel the usual ferocity coming from her though.
2921:Is she actually shocked that badly?
2922:ShireneÅgDon't look at me with pity in your eyes! That makes me feel even worse!Åh
2923:ShinkÅgH-hey!?Åh
2924:Even though class is nowhere near over yet, Shirene dashes out of the room.
2925:I wanted to help, but there's nothing I can do right now. I let out a small sigh.
2926:It seems that everyone else was also watching Shirene leave, and they're just as surprised as I am.
2927:RinÅgIt's rare to see Shirene lose her cool that badly.Åh
2928:CometÅgShe looked frustrated, but it felt different than normal. I'm a little worried.Åh
2929:VeraÅgShe'll be fine, just fine. She'll be back to normal soon enough, challenging me to another fight.Åh
2930:VeraÅgWell, not like she'll ever beat me though.Åh
2931:BibiÅgConfident as ever.Åh
2932:VeraÅg'Course!Åh
2933:Vera shoots Bibi a beaming smile as the bee girl laughs.
2934:Her expression practically oozes confidence that she'll never lose a fight.
2935:ShinkÅgSigh... Just when you finally show up to class, this happens. As if I needed another problem student...Åh
2936:I still haven't dealt with Shirene, and now I have another girl with bad habits around? Can I handle this?
Strong-seeming bad habit child is a recurring phrase that I can't put into English.
2937:VeraÅgUhh? Oh yeah, back to what I was wondering about when I arrived. What's this human?Åh
2938:ShinkÅgWhat's? Don't treat me like a thing...Åh
2939:RinÅgVera, that's really rude of you.Åh
2940:VeraÅgEven so, isn't it strange that there's a human at the academy? They aren't regularly eaten around here, are they?Åh
2941:ShinkÅgEaten!?Åh
2942:VeraÅgYeah. Once when my father came to visit, he was almost eaten by some idiot.Åh
2943:VeraÅgWell, my father's really strong so he sure turned the tables on her!Åh
This exchange didn't make sense until I realized Vera's father must be human. Guy from the Slime and Scylla VN I assume. This is what I get for not reading ahead.
2944:ShinkÅgTurned the tables...?Åh
2945:BibiÅgOh yeah, I remember that. Ha, it was quite interesting.Åh
2946:MiritaÅgThat wasn't a laughing matter. What ever happened to that girl anyway...Åh
2947:RinÅgIf I'm not mistaken, she should have graduated by now...Åh
2948:VeraÅgShe works in my house. She's so amazingly subservient that I laugh every time I see her.Åh
Amazingly underling-ish She uses two different but seemingly identical words for underling. Japanese has an insane number of words for that.
2949:ShinkÅg.........Åh
2950:The more I hear, the less I understand. But wait...
2951:ShinkÅgHold on, that means your father is human, Vera?Åh
2952:VeraÅgYep, that's right.Åh
2953:ShinkÅgOh, I see...Åh
2954:What kind of human could fight off a monster?
2955:VeraÅgSo come on, who is this guy?Åh
2956:RinÅgUmm, he's the newest teacher at the academy.Åh
2957:VeraÅgHuh? Teacher? This human?Åh
2958:MiritaÅgThat's why we said you're being rude.Åh
2959:VeraÅgHmmm, heeeey, a teacher eh...Åh
2960:ShinkÅgUm, yeah. I'm Shink Celestite. I recently took a position here.Åh
2961:VeraÅgFor a human, you're kinda lacking... You're less attractive than our underlings, not to mention my father.Åh
2962:ShinkÅgIs, is that so...Åh
2963:CometÅgNot true. Have more confidence in yourself, professor.Åh
2964:RinÅgThat's right! There isn't anything lacking about you!Åh
2965:ShinkÅg...thanks. It's fine though.Åh
2966:I'm not particularly confident in my looks either so they really don't need to cover for me.
2967:I'm more worried about Shirene than myself right now.
2968:ShinkÅgLet's end class here for today. We aren't going to get anything done even if we continue, but keep it down, okay?Åh
2969:RinÅgAh, okay. What are you going to do, Professor Shink? Chase after Shirene?Åh
2970:ShinkÅgUhh, yeah. I was thinking about it.Åh
2971:BibiÅgYou'd better not. Anything you try to do will only have the opposite effect.Åh
2972:ShinkÅgUgh, well...Åh
2973:She definitely could be right.
2974:VeraÅgUh huh. She was feeling helpless and at her wit's end. Shouldn't you leave her alone for now?Åh
2975:ShinkÅgEasy for you to say when you're the culprit...Åh
2976:VeraÅgI want her to feel this way when she picks a fight whenever we meet. I wish she'd give up since the outcome is always the same.Åh
FIXME do I have this line right? âÔÇ§ìxÇ…óçÇ‹ÇÍÇÈÇ±Ç¡ÇøÇÃãCéùÇøÇ…Ç‡Ç»Ç¡Çƒó~ÇµÇ¢Ç»ÇüÅB 
2977:RinÅgI think you're at fault too, Vera.Åh
2978:VeraÅgWhaa? There's no way this is my fault. I'm just fighting her like she wants.Åh
2979:CometÅgThe problem is that you're obviously going easy on her. That's why Shirene is so irritated.Åh
2980:MiritaÅgThat's right. Since Shirene is coming at you seriously, you need to fight her for real too.Åh
2981:VeraÅgThat'd be fine with me, but honestly? Given her skill, I'd probably kill her in an instant.Åh
2982:ShinkÅgReally...Åh
2983:There's that much of a difference between them?
2984:I could see a difference from watching the fight, but I can't believe the gap is that large.
2985:VeraÅgAre you doubting me? You're doubting me, aren't you?Åh
To make fun of, to make light of, to put down, to treat with contempt - none seem to fit
2986:ShinkÅgI didn't mean to imply any... Huh?Åh
2987:VeraÅgI could do this against Shirene too, you see?Åh
2988:ShinkÅg...!?Åh
2989:In what amounted to less than a blink of an eye, Vera disappeared from sight and ended up at my back.
2990:Despite the terror of hearing her whisper in my ear from behind, I turn around.
2991:VeraÅgDon't underestimate me, okay? I can kill you many times over before you can move a muscle.Åh
2992:ShinkÅg...gulp.Åh
2993:Her voice freezes me in place, and I feel closer to death than I have since I came to this academy.
2994:This little girl is capable of...
2995:VeraÅgBoo, hehe, ahahahaha!!Åh
2996:ShinkÅg!?!?Åh
2997:VeraÅgKidding, kidding! That was a joke. A joke!Åh
2998:ShinkÅgA... joke?Åh
2999:VeraÅgYep. I'm a friendly pirate, after all! I'd never start a fight with an ordinary person.Åh
3000:VeraÅgBesides, everyone else is giving me reeeeeally scary looks!Åh
3001:RinÅgVera, that was in poor taste.Åh
3002:CometÅgTch, a pity. I was just about to punch her out.Åh
3003:I inhale a deep breath in relief that I wasn't in mortal danger.
3004:When I look around the classroom, everyone else is doing their own thing as if this has nothing to do with them.
3005:It's enough to convince me that all this really is normal.
3006:VeraÅgWell, since I'll be attending class whenever possible from now on, I'm counting on you, Shink!Åh
3007:ShinkÅgWhat about my title...Åh
3008:VeraÅgAh? Is something wrong?Åh
3009:ShinkÅgNo, not really...Åh
3010:To be honest, it's rude to call people by their first name alone in other places, but even if I tell her, I doubt she'll listen.
3011:In any case, it's easier to just let her call me whatever she wants.
3012:ShinkÅgSigh... Another burden on my shoulders.Åh
3013:RinÅgUmm, good luck!Åh
3014:CometÅgTry your best!Åh
3015:ShinkÅg...of course.Åh
3016:I appreciate their words of support as I sigh, thinking about what to do.
3017:Vera is a concern, but I'm worried about Shirene too.
3018:Maybe I'd better go check how she's doing after this.
3019:KyuteÅgOh, I see. So that's what all that noise was about?Åh
3020:ShinkÅgUgh, you could actually hear that? Sorry.Åh
3021:KyuteÅgIt's fine. It's completely unavoidable when she returns. Quite an event, wasn't it?Åh
3022:ShinkÅgYeah, well...Åh
3023:After class, I came to Kyute's room to ask about the relationship between Vera and Shirene.
3024:Having already heard the disturbance earlier, Kyute gives me a sarcastic laugh.
3025:KyuteÅgNevertheless, it still ended up happening, huh...Åh
3026:ShinkÅgYeah, it was so sudden that I couldn't even stop them.Åh
3027:KyuteÅgThere's nothing you could have done. Only Mirita can stop them when they're fighting.Åh
3028:ShinkÅgEh...?Åh
3029:Mirita is capable of stopping them? Is she kidding?
3030:Or is Mirita really a better fighter than those two?
3031:KyuteÅgI know what you're thinking, but it's not like that.Åh
3032:ShinkÅgOh, I was wrong then.Åh
3033:KyuteÅgYeah, I can't tell you the details, but that girl has her secrets too...Åh
FIXME Probably need to do better on Ç†ÇÃéqÇ‡êFÅXÇ†ÇÈÇÃÇ≈
3034:ShinkÅgI see...Åh
3035:I don't really understand, but I suppose I shouldn't pry.
3036:The issue of Shirene and Vera is more important right now anyway.
3037:ShinkÅgSo those two don't get along at all?Åh
3038:KyuteÅgUmmm, I wouldn't say that. It's more like they're incompatible.Åh
3039:KyuteÅgShirene has improved herself through constant hard work, whereas Vera laughs at that and improves effortlessly.Åh
3040:KyuteÅgWell, that's not to say Vera doesn't put in any effort, she's just special...Åh
3041:KyuteÅgShe can obtain the same results with a tenth as much work as other people, and Shirene appears to resent her for it.Åh
3042:ShinkÅgAh, so she's one of those types.Åh
3043:Vera is a prodigy of sorts, and Shirene doesn't like her because she's the hardworking type.
3044:Vera doesn't appear to exert herself, and Shirene probably takes offense at her attitude.
3045:However, Vera's attitude seems to just be a result of her confidence. It doesn't mean she's arrogant at all.
3046:ShinkÅgThis is tough... Shirene felt she was being treated with contempt.Åh
3047:KyuteÅgYeah, since she gets crushed even when Vera is pulling her punches.Åh
3048:ShinkÅgAh, so Vera really was going easy on her?Åh
3049:KyuteÅgYeah. If she got serious, everyone at this academy together wouldn't be a match for her.Åh
3050:ShinkÅg.........Åh
3051:Just how special is she?
Non-standard = special
3052:ShinkÅgI'll try talking to them for the time being. Given their personalities, I don't know whether they'll listen though.Åh
3053:KyuteÅgI think Vera will. Even if she complains, she has a close relationship with humans.Åh
Even if she says this and that Might mean something like "Even though she complains about humans..." "close relationship, deep connection"
3054:ShinkÅgThat's good to hear at least...Åh
3055:Feeling a bit bummed out, I shake my head and clear my mind.
3056:I won't be able to accomplish anything if I don't have courage.
3057:I've got to get fired up and give this everything I've got.
3058:ShinkÅgThanks Kyute. I'm going to see what I can do.Åh
3059:KyuteÅgOkay, good luck.Åh
3060:Kyute gives me an encouraging smile as I bow and take my leave, off to find Shirene and Vera.
3061:Now then, where could the two of them be...
3062:ShireneÅgHey! I was saving that for last! You can't just steal my food!!Åh
3063:VeraÅgIt's your fault for letting me take it. Besides, you're the one that told me to try it if I had a chance.Åh
3064:ShireneÅgYou always have a comeback, don't you?Åh
3065:VeraÅgHmph. Blame yourself for showing me an opening. I didn't do anything wrong.Åh
3066:ShinkÅgHey, what was that?Åh
3067:As I look for the two troublemakers, I hear a disturbance in the dining hall and poke my head in to check it out.
3068:Inside, I see Shirene and Vera arguing and everyone else staring in displeasure that this is happening again.
3069:ShinkÅgWhat's going on here?Åh
3070:MiritaÅgOh, professor! Vera here is at it again.Åh
3071:VeraÅgHold on, Mirita! Don't make this sound like it's my fault.Åh
3072:MiritaÅgBut snatching food away from others is wrong.Åh
3073:VeraÅgWhy? Letting yourself be robbed is worse. Plus, only children save their favorite dish for last.Åh
3074:ShireneÅgAre you making fun of me!?Åh
3075:VeraÅgMaaaaybe? If that's what you think, maybe you're aware that it's true?Åh
3076:ShireneÅgI won't let you talk to me like this!Åh
3077:ShinkÅgH-hey now!Åh
3078:Shirene makes a fist, obviously irritated by Vera's prodding. Shirene uses her four legs to instantly close the distance and attack.
3079:VeraÅgMissed me!Åh
3080:ShireneÅgKyaaaaaa!!Åh
3081:Student 1ÅgWhoa!? Why's she coming towards us!?Åh
3082:Student 2ÅgAaaaah! My lunch!!Åh
3083:However, the moment Shirene reaches Vera, she is violently launched forwards from behind.
3084:Vera must have done something, but I didn't see a glimpse of it.
3085:ShinkÅgHey, not so rough! Are you all right, Shirene!?Åh
3086:VeraÅgShe's fine, just fine. I was careful to make sure she'd land safely.Åh
3087:MiritaÅgThat's not the problem...Åh
3088:ShireneÅgUgh, why... Why do I...!!Åh
3089:ShinkÅgAh, hey Shirene!!Åh
3090:Like Vera said, she doesn't appear hurt, but she does dash out of the dining hall with tears of frustration welling in her eyes.
3091:ShinkÅgDammit! I've got to catch up to her... whoa!?Åh
3092:I try to hurry after Shirene, but something trips me up and sends me tumbling to the floor.
3093:ShinkÅgWhat the!?Åh
3094:VeraÅgCalm down. Even if you chase after her now, at best she'll just ignore you.Åh
3095:ShinkÅgCome on now...Åh
3096:VeraÅgHey, hey, more importantly... so you're a teacher, right? I'm just a liiiitle bit interested in ya now, teach.Åh
3097:ShinkÅgTeach... whatever, fine. No point complaining, is there?Åh
3098:VeraÅgWoow, you catch on fast. I'm so proud, well done!Åh
3099:When I look at Vera's beaming smile, I can't bring myself to care about her lack of respect.
3100:I really should discipline her as a teacher, but...
3101:ShinkÅgSo what is your interest in me? Is there something you wanted to ask me about?Åh
3102:VeraÅgYeah, kind of. I don't need to ask about anything from the classes I missed though. I read the book and got the ideas.Åh
3103:ShinkÅgOh, is that so?Åh
3104:She really is gifted. As a teacher, I don't know whether to be happy for her ability or sigh because there's no need to teach her.
3105:VeraÅgWhat I really want to know is why you'd come here to teach. An ordinary human.Åh
3106:ShinkÅgCome again?Åh
3107:VeraÅgIt's just strange. You're not like my dad, Mirita's dad, or the other humans around here.Åh
3108:VeraÅgYou don't have any particular connection to monsters, do you Shink? You're just an ordinary human?Åh
3109:ShinkÅgWell, I guess you could say that...Åh
3110:VeraÅgSee? So why come to monster-controlled territory? Humans normally do their best to avoid us.Åh
3111:ShinkÅgI see, yeah...Åh
3112:It's hard to explain why I'm here though.
3113:It's not like I have some noble reason or that I'm completely fearless.
3114:ShinkÅgI guess it's just something I wanted to do.Åh
3115:VeraÅgWhat's that?Åh
3116:ShinkÅgWith the wars long in the past, humans and monsters have agreed on a pact of mutual noninterference.Åh
3117:ShinkÅgBut I don't think that's sustainable. If we continue on this path, eventually another war may break out.Åh
3118:ShinkÅgTherefore, I think it's important that we strive to get to know and understand each other better.Åh
3119:VeraÅg......Åh
3120:Right as I finish, I catch sight of Vera's silent reaction and return to reality.
3121:What am I doing telling all of this to a student...
3122:ShinkÅgSorry, I rambled on a bit too long.Åh
3123:VeraÅgHmm, no, far from it. Hehe... that's good.Åh
3124:ShinkÅgHuh?Åh
3125:VeraÅgNow I see. I thought it was strange that not only Rin, but even Comet had taken a liking to you, but I know now.Åh
3126:ShinkÅgEh, huh?Åh
3127:VeraÅgUh huh. I suppose I heard everything I wanted to. Goodbye!Åh
3128:ShinkÅgHey!?Åh
3129:As though she's convinced herself of something, Vera leaves the dining hall while laughing loudly.
3130:That was rather fruitless considering that I wanted to ask some things about Shirene.
3131:If I can't chase after her, what should I do instead?
3132:MiritaÅgUmm... good luck.Åh
3133:ShinkÅgThanks, I'll try to figure something out. It's sad that the two of them are on such bad terms.Åh
3134:MiritaÅgYeah, I think so too.Åh
3135:MiritaÅgYou're really amazing though, professor.Åh
3136:ShinkÅgAmazing?Åh
3137:Mirita, who was listening to the entire exchange from the beginning, gives me a thin smile full of embarrassment.
3138:It's a cute gesture, but I look back at her in confusion, not knowing what she means.
3139:MiritaÅgYeah. You have ideas you feel strongly about and are working hard at making them reality.Åh
3140:MiritaÅgI still can't even imagine what I want to do with my life... so I can't relate.Åh
3141:ShinkÅgI see...Åh
3142:Is this real life? Is she actually consulting me for advice?
3143:I don't think I'm all that amazing, but I have to respond with some advice nonetheless.
3144:In any case, the answer is obvious.
3145:ShinkÅgYou don't have to worry about that so much, you know.Åh
3146:MiritaÅgEh...?Åh
3147:ShinkÅgThere's no need to figure out what you want to do yet. You're still a student with your whole life ahead of you.Åh
3148:ShinkÅgYou'll discover your calling soon enough and find a way to accomplish it too.Åh
3149:MiritaÅgI see. I get it now.Åh
3150:Mirita looks down at the ground delighted and lets out a sigh of relief. Apparently my simple logic made an impact.
3151:Hearing that is also a relief to me. A reaffirmation that I really am capable of helping others.
3152:MiritaÅgThank you, professor. I feel a bit better now.Åh
3153:ShinkÅgI'm glad to hear it.Åh
3154:MiritaÅgIf you run into any trouble, just ask and I'll help you as best as I can.Åh
3155:ShinkÅgThanks. Glad I can count on you.Åh
3156:While replying to Mirita's kind offer, I can't help but think of Shirene and Vera.
3157:I guess I better do something sooner rather than later. Anyway, I'll have to try talking to Shirene first.
3158:With that decided, I finish lunch and head back to my room.
3159:ShinkÅgHaa...Åh
3160:In the end, I wasn't able to have a talk with Shirene yesterday.
3161:And if I do approach her, what should I even say...
3162:ShireneÅgNgh, haaaa!!Åh
3163:ShinkÅgOh, she's at it again today?Åh
3164:After how badly she was defeated, I thought she wouldn't be training today, but it turns out I was wrong.
3165:I follow the direction of her voice hoping this is a good opportunity to talk.
3166:ShireneÅgHa, teyaaaa!Åh
3167:ShinkÅg......?Åh
3168:Watching her train, I immediately notice something strange.
3169:It looks like she's wildly swinging her pole around without any of her usual poise.
3170:ShinkÅgMaybe I was right about her not being able to train like usual.Åh
3171:ShireneÅgWhy... Why can't I...!Åh
3172:Her eyes are wet with tears and her voice betrays frustration.
3173:I guess this is how she's dealing with not being able to beat Vera.
3174:Although there's nothing to gain from forcing herself to continue like this.
3175:ShinkÅgThere's no point, is there...Åh
3176:ShireneÅgNot enough... It's not enough... I have to get stronger... and stronger!Åh
3177:ShinkÅgNo, that's enough of that.Åh
3178:As Shirene recklessly attacks, I step between her swings and simply grab the pole.
3179:ShireneÅgUgh! What do you think you're doing!Åh
3180:ShinkÅgCalm down.Åh
3181:After finally noticing me only after I took her weapon, Shirene glares at me in irritation.
3182:I put the pole down and show her that I come in peace, but not without a serious look at the same time.
3183:ShireneÅgWhat the hell do you want? Are you just here to get in my way?Åh
3184:ShinkÅgIt's not like that at all. Look, there's no point making yourself...Åh
3185:ShireneÅgNo point? There's no point!?Åh
3186:ShinkÅgWhoa!?Åh
3187:Enraged at my words, Shirene takes a swing at me with a bloodthirsty look in her eyes.
3188:She's fast, but I dodge the wild and predictable blow while continuing to express my sincere concern.
3189:That only serves to piss her off further though. Undeterred, she presses the attack.
3190:ShinkÅgCalm down! I didn't do anything to you!Åh
3191:ShireneÅgShut up! Fuck! Why... Why can't I even beat a human...!!Åh
3192:After avoiding every punch she throws at me, she finally gives up.
3193:I stare at Shirene while catching my breath and see her body begin to shake and bitter tears flow down her cheeks.
3194:Ahh... It'd be better to give her a minute to cool down first.
3195:I wait around keeping my eye on her until it looks like she's no longer crying.
3196:ShinkÅgFeeling any better now?Åh
3197:ShireneÅgShut up and leave me alone.Åh
3198:I try talking to Shirene when she finally seems calm, but she blows me off like usual.
3199:However, it was a rather half-hearted rebuff that gives me the feeling that she might actually want to talk.
3200:ShireneÅgWhat? Did you come here to make fun of me like Vera?Åh
3201:ShinkÅgI told you that's not why I'm here.Åh
3202:ShireneÅgGive it back then. I still have more training to do.Åh
3203:ShinkÅgWhat kind of training involves swinging this around like a madwoman? What is that accomplishing?Åh
3204:ShireneÅgDon't butt in when you don't know what I'm going through!Åh
Because you don't even know my feelings, (doing) a 'selfish thing' / 'thing without permission' ...!
3205:ShinkÅgDo you really think I can't tell?Åh
Because even I understand, don't you think?
3206:ShireneÅgUngh...Åh
3207:I must have hit the mark because Shirene looks away from me in frustration and remains silent.
3208:Seeing her act like that, I breathe a sigh of relief and hand back the rod.
3209:ShireneÅgSo what do you want?Åh
3210:ShinkÅgLet's just talk, okay? For instance, why do you hate Vera so much?Åh
3211:ShireneÅg.........Åh
3212:She meets my question with silence, but I don't get the feeling it's because she doesn't want to talk about it.
3213:Rather, I think she's simply trying to come up with the right words.
3214:ShireneÅgVera, well...Åh
3215:ShinkÅgHmm?Åh
3216:ShireneÅgShe's always... like, the strength that takes people great efforts to build, she always surpasses it so easily.Åh
3217:ShireneÅgShe doesn't even do anything! She's so carefree, brimming with confidence... and laughing the whole time! She's making fun of me!Åh
3218:ShinkÅg......Åh
3219:Shirene starts off mumbling bit by bit and by the end her tone has become very emotional.
3220:ShireneÅgI fight her as hard as I can, but she acts like she doesn't care and never once makes a serious effort!Åh
3221:ShireneÅgIt's driving me crazy!Åh
3222:ShinkÅgI think I understand.Åh
3223:It sounds like she's going through some serious teen angst.
3224:Shirene can't stand being trifled with, and it probably feels like all her efforts are for nothing.
3225:From talking with Vera, it seems she isn't trying to make fun of Shirene, but that isn't getting across.
3226:ShinkÅgSo what is it that you want? To beat Vera?Åh
3227:ShireneÅgI already know... how impossible that is. But still...!Åh
3228:ShireneÅgIf she'd just act serious... Just once!Åh
3229:ShinkÅgI see.Åh
3230:Even though she's aware of the limits of her own ability, she still wants Vera to fight for real.
3231:It's quite a difficult position to be in, but I kind of understand how she feels.
3232:ShinkÅgThat can probably be arranged, I guess.Åh
3233:ShireneÅgWha...!?Åh
3234:ShinkÅgWell, if you had said you wanted to beat her, that would have been a challenge, but if you only want her to fight seriously...Åh
3235:Yeah, I think I can get her to do that at least.
3236:ShireneÅgAre you serious? You aren't screwing with me, are you!?Åh
3237:ShinkÅgI wouldn't lie about this. So, how about it?Åh
3238:No matter how much I want to help, it's still up to Shirene.
3239:Considering her issues with me, the question is whether she'll cast off her pride to get what she wants.
3240:ShireneÅgYou know I hate humans.Åh
3241:ShinkÅgYes, I do. Better than anyone.Åh
3242:ShireneÅgI'm not giving you my approval or anything, and I still don't understand what Rin and Comet see in you.Åh
I hate translating îFÇﬂÇÈ. Probably a better word than approval or way to phrase that. I think you get the idea.
3243:ShireneÅgBut if you can get Vera to fight seriously...Åh
3244:ShinkÅgOkay. That's fine with me.Åh
3245:Shirene looks happier than I've ever seen her around me, at least by a little.
3246:As I reach out my hand, I hope that ends up being the opportunity I needed for us to become friends.
3247:ShireneÅgThanks... for the help.Åh
3248:ShinkÅgGlad to be of service.Åh
3249:We shake on it. At the very least, I'm thrilled that I was finally able to have a real conversation with Shirene.
3250:ShinkÅgNow then...Åh
3251:Before I made the promise with Shirene, I felt down because there wasn't anything I could do.
3252:Now that I'm fired up, I've decided to use my spare time outside class to check on my students.
3253:Come to think of it, I have no idea what my students are like in their other classes.
3254:I've been here awhile already, but I've had my hands full just keeping up with my own problems...
3255:ShinkÅgAll right, time to see what this is like.Åh
3256:I quietly sneak in through the back door so that no one notices me come in.
3257:It looks like they're in the middle of Kyute's class.
3258:KyuteÅgThat's right. Now, how about this one?Åh
3259:Student 1ÅgWow, are you sure?Åh
3260:Student 2ÅgYeah, I remember hearing it was seen in the forest nearby.Åh
3261:Student 3ÅgNo way! We have to go hunt it down!Åh
3262:Student 1ÅgBut it's going to be really tough with just us.Åh
3263:Student 2ÅgThat's true, but it's Mirita here's turn!Åh
3264:MiritaÅgHuh? What's this about me?Åh
3265:Student 1ÅgA hunt, a hunt! They say a huge wild boar was spotted in the forest!Åh
3266:MiritaÅgUee!? Why does that make it my turn!?Åh
3267:Student 2ÅgYou're awesome at hunting, aren't you? They say your mom took down a giant beast back in her day...Åh
3268:MiritaÅgW-who told you that?Åh
3269:VeraÅgOops, sorry. That was me. Should I not have?Åh
3270:MiritaÅgNo, it's fine, but...Åh
3271:KyuteÅgYou all over there! Stop talking and pay attention in class!Åh
3272:MiritaÅgS-sorry...Åh
3273:Kyute finally heard and reprimanded Mirita and her friends. Sounds like they were talking about something dangerous.
3274:Even though this is my first time attending one of Kyute's lectures, I feel right at home.
3275:VeraÅgOh come on, your class is just too ordinary, Kyute.Åh
3276:KyuteÅgExcuse me, but please refer to me as 'professor' when we're on campus.Åh
3277:KyuteÅgFurthermore, there's nothing wrong with ordinary. If I did something unusual, it wouldn't be a lecture, would it?Åh
3278:Student 1ÅgHuh? But Professor Shink does nothing BUT unusual lessons.Åh
3279:Student 2ÅgYeah! Yeah! His are really interesting!Åh
3280:KyuteÅgCome on now...Åh
3281:ShinkÅg.........Åh
3282:I feel like I owe her an apology. Anyway, our subjects are totally different. It isn't fair to compare them.
3283:VeraÅgOooh? So Shink's class is that interesting, is it? Now I'm intrigued.Åh
3284:ShinkÅg.........Åh
3285:Knock it off everyone. I don't know how, but the expectations for my class are rising.
Hurdle regarding my lessons is rising
3286:Plus, listening to this in the middle of Kyute's class is making me feel really sorry for her.
3287:KyuteÅgSigh... All right, Vera, what's the answer to this problem?Åh
3288:VeraÅgI'd like to answer, but... Kyute?Åh
3289:KyuteÅgHm? Is something wrong?Åh
3290:VeraÅgThe solution in the setup is incorrect, isn't it? So how can I provide a correct answer to the problem?Åh
3291:KyuteÅgWha...? It, it should be fine...Åh
3292:Kyute turns to look at the exercise written on the blackboard.
3293:I don't see anything wrong with it though. Is Vera stalling for time or something?
3294:KyuteÅgGeh...Åh
3295:ShinkÅgOi...Åh
3296:After staring at it for a few moments, Kyute expression twists into a grimace as if she noticed something wrong.
3297:So there really was a mistake? Sorry that I doubted you, Vera.
3298:VeraÅgSo what do you want me to do? Should I correct the exercise from the beginning and then answer?Åh
3299:KyuteÅgAh, ahaha... No, there's no way I'd make you do all that.Åh
3300:KyuteÅgLook, erase this, change that... There, all fixed! Now Vera, what's the answer?Åh
3301:VeraÅgThat's a lot of unnecessary work, Kyute. It's a lot easier to understand like this.Åh
3302:KyuteÅg.........Åh
3303:ShinkÅgWow, it is.Åh
3304:Looking over Vera's equation and solution, I nod my head in understanding.
3305:But from Kyute's position...
3306:KyuteÅgAhahahaha... So it is. Make sure you remember this everyone!Åh
3307:She's dodging the issue!?
Glossing over? bleh
3308:KyuteÅgHaa... there goes my confidence.Åh
3309:ShinkÅg...don't let it get to you.Åh
3310:She probably can't hear me from here, but seeing Kyute in such a slump, I offer some words of encouragement anyway.
3311:That aside, I have a good appreciation for Vera's genius now.
3312:Students like that sure can be a lot of trouble...
3313:KyuteÅgOkay, moving on to the next problem...Åh
3314:Kyute takes back control of her class, resuming the lesson. Until the bell chimes, I continue to focus on her.
3315:ShinkÅgHmm...Åh
3316:In the end, only Vera's commotion, or should I say brilliance, stood out from the rest of the class.
3317:The other students had their turns asking questions and giving answers, but none had the same elegance as Vera's solution.
3318:Her superiority is somewhat scary, but she isn't isolated from the rest of her peers, perhaps because of her personality.
3319:From what I saw in her fight with Shirene, her physical strength can't be ignored either.
3320:ShinkÅgCan I really pull this off?Åh
3321:Since she doesn't seem conceited or anything, if we do something unexpected, she'll probably have to get serious at least for a second.
Not seeing how those clauses fit together that well. "Since It doesn't appear likely she is bloated with pride"?
3322:The trick is going to convincing Shirene...
3323:ShireneÅgI refuse. There's no way I could do that!Åh
3324:ShinkÅgThat's what I thought...Åh
3325:I tried thinking up a plan based on what I saw from Vera today, but Shirene rejected it out of hand.
3326:Well, I knew it wouldn't be easy to get the straight-laced Shirene to go along with a deception like this.
3327:ShinkÅgCome on, you have to admit that she'll easily deal with a simple frontal attack.Åh
3328:ShireneÅgThat's not true. If I keep battering her down, even Vera will eventually be driven back!Åh
Bleh. "Driven into a corner" literally
3329:ShinkÅgHmm...Åh
3330:It certainly would be better if we could make the direct approach work, but...
3331:When it comes to a straight-up fight, Shirene is stupidly predictable.
3332:If she won't even mix a single feint into her attacks, she'll never win.
3333:No matter how fast she is, if someone learns her pattern, they'll always see her coming.
3334:What am I supposed to do about that...
3335:ShireneÅgWhat, you think I'm wrong? My idea isn't good enough for you?Åh
3336:ShinkÅgUm, I didn't mean to...Åh
3337:VeraÅgJust go right out and say it. Tell her that her methods are never going to work no matter how hard she tries.Åh
3338:ShinkÅgGah!?Åh
3339:ShireneÅgVera!? What are you doing here!?Åh
3340:VeraÅgI was simply following you around to see what kind of conspiracy you were up to behind my back.Åh
3341:ShinkÅgYou were spying on us the whole time??Åh
3342:VeraÅgHuh? Yeah, that's right.Åh
3343:Seriously? I didn't feel like anyone was watching...
3344:There's nothing ordinary about this girl at all, is there?
3345:VeraÅgSo? Did you come up with any good ways to beat me?Åh
3346:ShireneÅgNgh!Åh
3347:VeraÅgNothing was going to work anyway. You'll neeeever beat me like you are now, Shirene.Åh
3348:ShireneÅgDon't make light of me!Åh
I'd usually translate this as "underestimate" but that doesn't capture Shirene's wounded pride.
3349:ShinkÅgHey, hey now!!Åh
3350:Vera's provocation enrages Shirene who thrusts forward just like she always does.
3351:No feints, only a series of direct attacks. As expected...
3352:VeraÅgNow you're the one underestimating... ME!Åh
3353:ShireneÅgUgh, kyaaaa!!Åh
3354:The earth rumbles, and Shirene is slapped to the ground.
3355:Vera took her out without even having to use her arms.
3356:Victorious, she looks down on Shirene in displeasure without a drop of sweat on her.
3357:VeraÅgTell me, Shirene, what are you after?Åh
3358:ShireneÅgNgh, what...Åh
3359:VeraÅgYou want to defeat me? Look, if you're serious about that, aren't you the one making light of me?Åh
3360:ShireneÅgWhat are you getting at?Åh
What are you trying to say "What do you want to say"
3361:VeraÅgWho knows? Why don't you figure it out yourself? I'm not that nice.Åh
3362:VeraÅgShink went to the trouble to advise you, but you ignored him and this happened. Maybe you're hopeless after all.Åh
3363:With clear disdain on her face, Vera has harsh words with Shirene.
3364:Her words themselves are mean, but I wonder if she isn't exaggerating for effect.
3365:Despite what she's saying, she vaguely looks like she's enjoying herself.
These two sentences are fairly redundant and don't flow well.
3366:I don't know what to think about her attitude...
Kind of like "I can't figure her out..." as in he doesn't know if she's really mad or faking it for some reason
3367:ShireneÅg.........Åh
3368:VeraÅgSigh. So you don't even have the strength to fight back verbally. I'm disappointed.Åh
3369:VeraÅgI'm outta here Shink. Do as much as you can for this stubborn ass.Åh
Ç∂Ç·Ç∂Ç·în is an unmanageable woman, shrew, stubborn tomboy but it has the kanji for horse in it too.
3370:ShinkÅgIt might not work out, but I'll see what I can manage.Åh
3371:VeraÅgNuhuhu, I'm looking forward to it.Åh
3372:With that, Vera leaves, a pleased smile on her face.
3373:As she walks away, I turn my attention back to Shirene who's still sprawled out on the ground in shock.
3374:ShireneÅgI'm... making fun of her? How...Åh
3375:ShinkÅgHaa...Åh
3376:I guess we'd better not postpone talking about this...
3377:Well, it is my job as a teacher to guide students properly. I'll just have to cross my fingers this goes well.
3378:ShinkÅgHere, drink some tea and settle down.Åh
3379:ShireneÅgTch, I'm over it alreadyÅh
3380:ShinkÅgYou definitely aren't.Åh
3381:After what happened, I took Shirene back to her room, but I don't know how to break her out of this crushing depression.
3382:Maybe I should be straight and honest with her, but perhaps that isn't the best idea given the circumstances.
3383:ShireneÅgI'm not making light of Vera or anything like that. What is she even talking about...Åh
3384:ShinkÅgHmm, yeah...Åh
3385:I can only scratch my head and nod while listening to Shirene mumble under her breath.
3386:The topic came up because of me so I suppose I have to answer her honestly.
3387:It's going to be hard for her to hear though... Damn, being a teacher is tough.
3388:ShinkÅgI hate to say it, but she's kind of right.Åh
3389:ShireneÅgHow is she right?!Åh
3390:ShinkÅgYou want Vera to fight seriously, correct? Even though you know you can't match her in raw power?Åh
3391:ShireneÅg......Åh
3392:ShinkÅgYou refuse to even consider other approaches too. So aren't you kind of screwing around with her?Åh
3393:ShinkÅgI'm not saying that a fair fight is bad. I mean, if you're going to fight someone, that's the preferred way of doing it.Åh
3394:ShinkÅgBut Shirene, your way of fighting is honest to a fault. It's stupidly predictable.Åh
3395:ShireneÅgStupidly predictable!?Åh
This phrase used 3 times so far is like "honest to a fault" but sounds a lot more insulting in Japanese, hence "stupidly predictable"
3396:ShinkÅgYeah, you never feint or anything. You can't beat a stronger opponent with nothing but frontal attacks.Åh
3397:ShinkÅgThat's why Vera feels like you're screwing around.Åh
3398:ShireneÅgOh...Åh
3399:Shirene looks down and grinds her teeth in frustration. I don't think she's taking it well.
3400:I don't like being the bad guy to one of my students either, but adults and teachers have to tell hard truths sometimes.
3401:ShireneÅgThat's possible... I guess. You might be right that I've been making light of her.Åh
3402:ShireneÅgI thought I was right. About fighting, about Vera... but I've been getting angry for the wrong reasons.Åh
3403:ShinkÅg......Åh
3404:ShireneÅgAll right. I'll agree to your schemes or anything if it'll get Vera to fight me seriously.Åh
3405:ShinkÅgEven if they won't necessarily allow you to win?Åh
3406:ShireneÅgThat's fine. I want to beat her, but that's pretty much impossible for me now...Åh
3407:ShireneÅgBut first things first, let's get her to fight for real.Åh
3408:ShinkÅgI see...Åh
3409:The more Shirene speaks, the more I can see the fires of determination burning in her eyes.
3410:Fortunately, it looks like I was able to keep her from recklessly continuing down the wrong path.
Bleh
3411:ShireneÅgThis is all your idea though so you better not leave me hanging without seeing it through.Åh
3412:ShinkÅgHey now, I'd never do that!Åh
3413:ShireneÅgHehe, okay. I'm looking forward to working with you on this.Åh
3414:ShinkÅg......Åh
3415:Shirene extends her hand, a soft smile on her face. I'm surprised but manage to shake on it anyway.
3416:I'm pretty sure that's the first time she's ever smiled at me. Have I broken down the wall between us, even if only a little?
3417:Just the prospect of it lifts my spirits.
3418:ShireneÅgSo what's the plan for today?Åh
3419:ShinkÅgOh. I wasn't thinking of doing anything particularly unique.Åh
3420:ShireneÅgAre you serious? Don't you have some special tactics or secret training regimen in mind?Åh
3421:ShinkÅgNo and no.Åh
3422:I can see a somewhat expectant look in Shirene's eyes as I wave my hand to dismiss the idea.
3423:She already has a solid foundation, after all. There's no need to learn something completely new now.
3424:If she can just add in a few feints and tricks, she should be able to fight much better than before.
3425:ShinkÅgIf anything, you need to understand feints and how to properly apply them to your fighting style.Åh
3426:ShireneÅgMmmngh... that's true. It's definitely going to take some time to change my approach.Åh
3427:ShinkÅgIndeed.Åh
3428:ShireneÅgAll right. You think up some tricks for me, and I'll focus on my fighting style.Åh
3429:ShinkÅgRoger that.Åh
3430:With an expression of diligence on her face, Shirene trots off, mumbling under her breath as she thinks to herself.
3431:For my part, I begin trying to come up with ways to trick Vera.
3432:I do have a nagging doubt in my mind though. Is it really all right for me to be doing this?
3433:It's generally frowned upon for a teacher to play favorites with his students, but perhaps this is good for them both?
3434:RinÅgWh-what are you doing, Professor Shink!Åh
3435:ShinkÅgHuh? Oh, it's Rin. What are you doing here?Åh
3436:RinÅgI asked you that first! Wh-when did you become such good friends with Shirene...!?Åh
3437:ShinkÅgGood friends? Does it really look that way?Åh
3438:CometÅgConsidering how she usually acts towards you, very strange. Bribery?Åh
3439:ShinkÅgDon't be crass.Åh
3440:She is kind of right though...
3441:ShinkÅgI'm simply helping Shirene out a bit. She asked me to lend her some wisdom in confronting Vera.Åh
Bleh.
3442:CometÅgWisdom? That's not like Shirene. Suspicious.Åh
3443:ShireneÅgHow rude. Is it really so strange that I'd use my head?Åh
3444:CometÅgYes. You're simple-minded and wouldn't ever employ strategy. Wait, are you a fake?Åh
Bleh.
3445:ShireneÅgSimple-minded... So everyone really does think that...Åh
3446:Shirene slumps her shoulders and hangs her head.
3447:Damn, hearing her classmates confirm the suspicion that's been nagging at her...
3448:RinÅgB-but why the sudden change?Åh
3449:ShireneÅgWhy? This human told me as much. Well, I was probably already convinced of it myself.Åh
3450:ShinkÅgIf I've been so helpful already, how about using my name...Åh
3451:ShireneÅgIf this goes well, I'll consider it.Åh
3452:ShinkÅgI'll hold you to that.Åh
3453:That gives me some added motivation.
3454:I would love to not be called "human" or "you" for the rest of the year.
3455:RinÅgTh-this means... I have another rival? Maybe not, but...Åh
3456:CometÅgRelax. That isn't certain yet. It's best to wait and see.Åh
3457:RinÅgB-but Comet, if even Shirene manages to...Åh
3458:CometÅgUnintentionally nudging her along would be worse. But if that's how you feel, go right ahead.Åh
3459:RinÅgUghhhh, you're so mean, Comet.Åh
3460:ShinkÅg......???Åh
3461:What are those two talking about?
3462:ShireneÅgIf you're just going to bother us, would you please leave? I'm taking this seriously.Åh
3463:RinÅgSorry. I'll stay out of your way.Åh
3464:CometÅgHmm, so moe. Shirene is burning with passion...!Åh
3465:ShireneÅgSigh... whatever. Hey you, do your part too.Åh
3466:ShinkÅgYeah yeah.Åh
3467:Shirene sighs and returns to practice while I think up some tactics she can use to defeat Vera.
3468:ShireneÅgHaa, haa...Åh
3469:Several hours later, night has fallen and Rin and Comet have returned to their rooms.
3470:Even Shirene is beginning to look tired. It'd probably be best to call it a day.
3471:ShinkÅgHey, Shirene. It's getting late. How about we end here?Åh
3472:ShireneÅgYeah, you're right. That sounds good.Åh
3473:ShinkÅgOh, I'm surprised. I was expecting you to demand that we continue.Åh
3474:ShireneÅgRude human. I know my own limits.Åh
3475:ShinkÅgI see...Åh
3476:It would certainly be bad if she didn't, I suppose.
3477:ShireneÅgI am still worried though. Are these simple tactics really going to be enough?Åh
3478:ShinkÅgHmm? Yeah, they should be.Åh
3479:Everything I came up with is rather simple.
3480:Vera would normally have no difficulty countering them.
3481:However, if she's expecting Shirene to attack like she usually does, they should catch her off guard.
3482:ShinkÅgIf everything goes as I expect, at least.Åh
3483:ShireneÅgThat's supposed to reassure me? I'm even more worried now.Åh
3484:ShinkÅgDon't worry, don't worry. You can do it.Åh
3485:ShireneÅgYes... yes, I can. I'm grateful for all your help so far. The rest is up to me...Åh
3486:With that said, Shirene adopts a serious expression and falls into silence.
3487:It looks like she's visualizing the fight in her mind.
3488:ShinkÅgCome on. It's good to be focused, but we really should head back.Åh
3489:ShireneÅgYes. You're right.Åh
3490:I turn around and begin walking back to my room.
3491:With a nod of her head and the same serious expression, Shirene follows.
3492:Man, she really is taking this seriously... I hope it all works out somehow.
3493:ShinkÅgEh, what are you doing here?Åh
3494:PhamÅgThat's no way to greet your good friend.Åh
3495:ShinkÅgI, for one, don't recall us being that close.Åh
3496:PhamÅgMeanie. Even with the love between us running so deep...Åh
3497:ShinkÅgThat isn't the truth and you know it.Åh
3498:She really does appear at the most unexpected times and say the strangest things.
3499:PhamÅgPerhaps so. Well, no matter.Åh
3500:ShinkÅgDon't insinuate things then...Åh
3501:PhamÅgPlayfulness is a necessary component of life. There's no point going on about that when I'm dead though, I suppose.Åh
3502:With a teasing laugh, Pham slaps me on the shoulder. I'm so surprised that I don't make any attempt to stop her.
3503:She certainly is gloomy, but complaining about that here isn't going to get me anywhere.
Parallel with Pham's last line.
3504:Just having a friendly chat with a ghost is a really strange feeling though.
3505:I bet I'd be scared out of my mind under normal circumstances, but I don't feel that way around Pham at all.
3506:ShinkÅgSo what's the occasion for your visit? I assume you didn't wander in here for no reason.Åh
3507:PhamÅgTrue, true. I was watching. It looks like you're getting along with the girl who hates humans.Åh
3508:ShinkÅgGetting along with her... maybe.Åh
3509:I'd love for that to be the case, but I'm not sure we've reached that point yet.
3510:PhamÅgBe confident in yourself. You're going to need to be very soon.Åh
3511:ShinkÅgHuh? Is something going to happen?Åh
3512:PhamÅgHmm, I wonder? You'll find out soon enough. Just how serious that girl is.Åh
3513:ShinkÅg???Åh
3514:As usual, I have no idea what she means. What is she hinting at?
3515:PhamÅgOops, time for me to go. I'm not in the habit of spying on what people do in private.Åh
3516:ShinkÅgCould have fooled me.Åh
3517:PhamÅgHehe. Bye bye!Åh
These two lines don't translate at all. "From which mouth says that" "This cute mouth" She responds literally to a figure of speech.
3518:ShinkÅgH-hey!Åh
3519:Pham vanishes, leaving me to wonder whether she was joking or being serious.
3520:What a free spirit...
3521:ShinkÅgDamn... I can't pin down why, but I've got a bad feeling.Åh
3522:I hope it's just my imagination.
3523:ShireneÅgPardon the entrance.Åh
3524:ShinkÅgHuh...?Åh
3525:After Pham left, I was just about to go to bed when Shirene shows up.
3526:Shocked at her sudden entrance, I stare fixedly at her face in surprise.
3527:ShireneÅgWhat? Why the surprised look? Is it that strange that I'd come to visit you?Åh
3528:ShinkÅgUmm, maybe not strange, but unusual at least.Åh
3529:ShireneÅgAs much as I hate coming into a human's room, there's something I need you for.Åh
3530:ShinkÅgWhat's that?Åh
3531:Now I'm really confused. Maybe she needs me to go over the plan once more?
3532:No, there's no way she has any questions left after all the work we put in.
3533:ShireneÅgIt's about your strategies. They may very well end up being effective against Vera, but...Åh
3534:ShireneÅgI'm still feeling uneasy. I might fail simply because I'm not strong enough...Åh
3535:ShinkÅgNo, I doubt...Åh
3536:I can't tell her that's not a possibility.
3537:But it's no use telling her the truth either.
3538:ShinkÅgCome on, have some confidence in yourself. You're hardly a weakling.Åh
Parallel to Pham telling Shink to have confidence
3539:ShireneÅgI know, but... I should do everything I can to improve my odds, shouldn't I?Åh
3540:ShinkÅgOkay, sure.Åh
3541:ShireneÅgSo... that's why I came here.Åh
3542:ShinkÅg......??Åh
3543:What is she trying to tell me?
3544:What can I help her with? It looks like she's blushing and see isn't even making eye contact...
3545:ShinkÅgThere's something I can do to help?Åh
3546:ShireneÅgThat's right. You're the only one I can ask.Åh
3547:ShinkÅgMe?Åh
3548:ShireneÅgYes. So ummm, are you aware of methods monsters can use to quickly gain strength?Åh
3549:ShinkÅgMethods to quickly gain strength?Åh
3550:If I recall correctly, I do remember hearing about one of those methods.
3551:Something about extracting the life energy out of people?
3552:There were stories about monsters taking the energy from captured humans to recover or get stronger during the wars.
3553:ShinkÅgWait! Don't tell me!Åh
3554:ShireneÅgYes, that's it.Åh
3555:ShinkÅgH-hold on! I thought you hated humans!? How could you...!Åh
3556:ShireneÅgYes, I hate them. But I don't hate you that badly considering you are helping me out.Åh
3557:ShinkÅgHey that's just...Åh
3558:W-what the? How did we get to this point so quickly?
3559:ShinkÅgSo then what are you planning on?Åh
3560:ShireneÅgYou're a human, after all. If you're going to help, go all the way by providing me with nourishment.Åh
3561:Shink
3562:ÅgSo that IS what you meant!Åh
3563:I was an idiot for having a sliver of hope that I was wrong. No, maybe I was really counting on being wrong.
3564:Anyway, this is bad! She's going to use me as food.
3565:I've got to change her mind somehow!
3566:ShinkÅgW-wait! If you do this, you won't be winning with your own strength!Åh
3567:ShireneÅgBy using your clever schemes, I'm already relying on more than myself. So what's wrong with this?Åh
3568:ShinkÅgLots! A man and a woman shouldn't rush into...Åh
3569:ShireneÅgWhat are you talking about. We're monster and human. This is a relationship between predator and prey, no?Åh
3570:ShireneÅgThere's no way I'd look forward to having a sexual relationship with a weak species like humanity.Åh
3571:ShireneÅgI'm not interested in you in that way at all. Do you think I'd be too ashamed or something to do this?Åh
Bleh?
3572:ShinkÅgGuh...Åh
3573:I suppose not... but wait!
3574:ShinkÅgThen why were you mad when we first met? You were embarrassed to be seen naked by a human, weren't you?Åh
3575:ShireneÅgYes, I was. Of course it's embarrassing to be seen naked by a human.Åh
3576:ShinkÅgThen why are you okay with it now!?Åh
3577:ShireneÅgThis time I'm letting you see my body for a reason. It's completely different.Åh
3578:ShinkÅgNo, it's even...!Åh
3579:How is this not way more embarrassing!?
3580:Is this just accepted practice among monsters or something?
3581:ShireneÅgSo are you done fighting the inevitable? If so, prepare yourself.Åh
3582:ShinkÅgPrepare what!? I obviously don't want to do this!Åh
Both lines bleh
3583:Realizing that I'm not going to win this with words, I try to beat a hasty retreat.
3584:Sadly, Shirene is much faster. She grabs me around the waist and throws me down.
3585:ShireneÅgI'm not going to let you escape like that either.Åh
3586:ShinkÅgGuh...!Åh
3587:On the ground with Shirene pinning me down, I'm out of options.
3588:ShinkÅgDammit, come on!Åh
3589:ShireneÅgBe quiet! I have to do this, you know!Åh
3590:Sprawled out on the floor of my room, Shirene prevents me from moving.
3591:There's absolutely no way I can escape while her hefty body is on top of me.
3592:But if I can't think of a way to escape soon, this is going to get really bad.
3593:ShinkÅgPlease reconsider, Shirene. You don't really have to...Åh
3594:ShireneÅgShut up! I'm not the kind of woman who changes her mind once I've decided on something.Åh
3595:ShireneÅgCome on, hurry up and give me your energy!Åh
3596:ShinkÅgThat's not the way it works!Åh
3597:Shirene looks down at the floor instead of at me as she absurdly asks me that. I complain and struggle underneath her.
3598:But no matter how hard I try, I can't get her off. All my struggling is doing is rubbing my penis against her leg.
3599:ShireneÅgEwww, what are you doing? Don't touch me with that thing.Åh
3600:ShinkÅgIsn't that exactly what you came here to do in the first place!?Åh
3601:I lose my cool and lash out in the face of her completely irrational anger.
3602:As I move, I end up stimulating my penis even further by accident.
3603:Her soft hair glides against my tender skin, imparting a very unusual sensation.
3604:ShireneÅgI know that, of course. You understand that I'm just doing this to get sustenance from you, right?Åh
3605:ShireneÅgSo don't get any weird ideas!Åh
3606:Shirene makes sure she gets that point across, but can't even look in my direction as she says it.
3607:As our bodies move, my penis strikes and bounces off her knees repeatedly.
3608:Even though the stimulation isn't intentional, the feel of her hair and having a girl leaning over me fills my penis with blood.
3609:ShinkÅgOh crap...!Åh
3610:I instantly try to focus on calming myself down, but the more I try, the more my thoughts concentrate on sex.
3611:ShireneÅgEeh, wh-what the...?Åh
3612:I can see the surprise written on Shirene's face as my penis hardens and rubs against her body.
3613:ShinkÅgThat's enough. Get off me... It'd be better for the both of us if we don't go any further.Åh
3614:ShireneÅgW-why... I was just a little surprised by the way it felt. That's all.Åh
3615:ShireneÅgSince it got bigger, that means you like it, right? So I should keep doing it like this?Åh
3616:ShinkÅgGuh...!Åh
3617:Despite her surprise, Shirene rubs her legs against my shaft like she's using it to flatten out her hair.
3618:The soft hairs feel wonderful, but occasionally prick my skin, causing my waist to shoot up into the air.
3619:ShireneÅgH-hey now, stop squirming around. This is surprisingly difficult.Åh
3620:ShireneÅgAaah, dammit! You moved again! Didn't I tell you to stop squirming?!Åh
3621:ShinkÅgEasier said than done!Åh
3622:As Shirene strokes me in an attempt to squeeze out my semen, my penis reacts by pulsing and throbbing out of control.
3623:Shirene persistently moves her legs, applying a gentle but steady stimulation.
3624:ShinkÅgKuh, you're... ngh!Åh
3625:ShireneÅgThis took a little getting used to, but I'm getting the hang of it I think.Åh
3626:ShireneÅgMmmngh... It's still not coming out though...Åh
3627:Shirene starts muttering to herself, making me think that she expected semen to immediately shoot out with a simple touch.
3628:If I don't get away soon, it's going to be too late...
3629:ShireneÅgDammit, come on! Hurry up!Åh
3630:ShinkÅgUuugh!Åh
3631:Influenced by a mixture of irritation and anger, Shirene roughly plays with my penis between her knees.
3632:Her sudden motion catches me off guard, and I can't stop my body from reacting this time.
3633:ShireneÅgHuh...? That got a reaction out of you just now, didn't it?Åh
3634:ShinkÅgNo... No it did not.Åh
3635:ShireneÅgNo, it definitely moved. So I'm thinking if I use my legs like this...Åh
3636:ShinkÅgKuh...Åh
3637:As if realizing something, Shirene resumes slowly nuzzling her legs against my shaft.
3638:No matter how much I want to resist, my penis trembles in joy and springs up of its own accord.
3639:ShireneÅgI see, that was it. So it feels good when I rub you like this...Åh
3640:ShinkÅgNo matter how long you do that... I'm not going to come...Åh
3641:I do my best to endure the pleasant sensations and put up a brave front.
3642:ShireneÅgIs that so... If you don't come soon, I'm not going to be pleased either.Åh
3643:ShireneÅgSo... how about I try this?Åh
3644:ShinkÅg...ugh!?Åh
3645:Apparently she believed me. Staring at my penis with a look of determination, Shirene slowly reaches out her hand and touches the tip.
3646:Her fingers are not only smooth, but also hard like you'd expect from someone who exercises often. My shaft springs up with a start.
3647:ShireneÅgNgh, it's warmer than I expected... And so firm too...Åh
3648:ShinkÅgKuh...Åh
3649:ShireneÅgIt's trembling so much in my hand... Ngh, this is making you feel good, isn't it...Åh
3650:The embarrassment Shirene is clearly feeling doesn't stop her from tracing her fingers around my sensitive glans.
3651:My shaft keeps twitching in pleasure from the slightly cool sensation of her hand against my skin.
3652:ShireneÅgIt feels kind of weird having this thing twitching so much.Åh
3653:ShireneÅgWill it feel even better if I rub you a little harder?Åh
3654:ShinkÅgUgh, Shirene... No more...Åh
3655:ShireneÅgHaa, looks like I have the answer to that then..Åh
3656:Shirene is convinced by my reaction that she's on the right track and continues awkwardly probing for my sensitive areas.
3657:Each time she finds one, my penis leaps into her hand as if telling her that it desires more stimulation there.
3658:The combined sensations of her hand and the hair on her legs make me desire release more and more.
3659:ShinkÅgUgh, Shirene. I'm not kidding, please stop...Åh
3660:ShireneÅgNo way. Besides, it doesn't look like this guy agrees with you.Åh
3661:ShireneÅgIt's getting hotter and harder... and what's this... ngh, a little bit of something is coming out of the end...Åh
3662:She's right. I can feel the precum coating the tip of my penis.
3663:Her fingers scoop it up and smear it all over my glans with every movement.
3664:ShireneÅgNgh... This is a sign you're going to come, right? It shouldn't be long now then...Åh
3665:ShinkÅgUgh, haaa... I'm not giving in no matter how hard you try...!Åh
3666:ShireneÅgYou're bluffing. There's nothing you can do if your penis wants to come, is there?Åh
3667:ShireneÅgLook, when I stroke it harder, you can't stop the precum from pouring out.Åh
3668:Shirene's hands quicken their movements, lubricated by the viscous fluid coating my penis.
3669:Her precise rubbing motions urge my semen to accelerate its flow from my body.
3670:ShinkÅgKuh... You're making it so slippery... If you keep doing that...Åh
3671:ShireneÅgOooh, it feels good when it's all wet like this, doesn't it...Åh
3672:ShireneÅgSo let me... make it nice and smooth for you... Nnnaaa!Åh
3673:ShinkÅgWhoa...!?Åh
3674:Noticing my reaction, it looks like Shirene has a new idea.
3675:She leans forward, opens her mouth, and coats my penis in a thick strand of saliva.
3676:ShinkÅgHaaa... This is too much...Åh
3677:ShireneÅgHehe, just as I thought. Now if I squeeze a little tighter...Åh
3678:With my penis now slick with both saliva and precum, she strokes it with not just her hands, but sandwiches me between her legs as well.
Too long?
3679:The sensation of her soft hands and the feel of her hair excite me whether I desire it or not, and I can't hide my desire to come.
3680:ShireneÅgNgh, haa... Looks like it's working. I'm thinking you should come soon if I keep this up...Åh
3681:ShireneÅgSee look, your hot liquid is pouring out nonstop... There's no need to hold back.Åh
3682:ShinkÅgI'll... endure...Åh
3683:ShireneÅgNo you won't. You're twitching so badly that you're pushing back against my legs.Åh
3684:ShireneÅgStop being stubborn and let it all out! That will make you feel better too.Åh
3685:ShinkÅgUngh...Åh
3686:As though turned on by the situation and the heat off my penis, Shirene's voice mellows as she urges me towards ejaculation.
3687:She strokes my shaft from bottom to top in one fluid motion, and as it springs up, she pinches my glans between her fingers.
3688:Toyed like that, a torrent of semen biding its time inside of me begins its explosive ascent.
3689:ShireneÅgIt's somehow getting hotter and hotter... And larger too...Åh
3690:ShireneÅgEven the smell is stronger. Let it out... Come on, hurry up and shoot it out!Åh
3691:ShinkÅgUgh, if you grab it that hard...!Åh
3692:Sensing the changes in my penis, Shirene suddenly goes from gentle, mild stroking to being more aggressive.
3693:Unable to resist the abrupt, intense stimulation, my waist launches into the air.
3694:ShinkÅgUngh, can't hold... any more...!Åh
3695:ShireneÅgHuh, what...? It's swelling all of a sudden... kyaaa!Åh
3696:Unable to cope with the unexpected change in stimulation, I lose control and ejaculate.
3697:Shirene opens her eyes wide in surprise as I dirty her hands and legs with my cloudiness.
3698:ShireneÅgNgh, haa... I didn't expect that. It's hot, and what a pungent smell...Åh
3699:ShireneÅgSo this is semen. My head feels like it's getting dizzy...Åh
3700:ShinkÅgUgh, haaa...Åh
3701:Despite regret over not being able to prevent myself from ejaculating, I yield to the feeling of liberation.
3702:As I relax, my shaft continues twitching, leaking out more and more semen.
3703:ShireneÅgIt isn't stopping... It just keeps flowing out. What a strange sensation...Åh
3704:ShinkÅgUngh...Åh
3705:Shirene moves her hand around in my semen as though exploring what it feels like.
3706:In doing so, she gives me further stimulation, which keeps my penis erect.
3707:ShireneÅgNgh, haaa... But this isn't enough to drink. I need to collect it better...Åh
3708:ShinkÅgUgh, what are...Åh
3709:ShireneÅgYou don't mind, do you? You're still hard so you can come again, right?Åh
3710:ShinkÅg...!?Åh
3711:Disappointed that she wasn't able to collect enough semen, Shirene resumes stroking my slick penis.
3712:Perhaps because it's more slippery than before, she rubs up and down faster, getting the remaining dregs of semen to come out.
3713:ShireneÅgIt's steadily twitching... and I can feel something moving around inside there...Åh
3714:ShireneÅgCome on, I'll make sure I can swallow it properly this time so hurry up and give me more!Åh
3715:ShinkÅgAgh, that's too strong!Åh
3716:Shirene's stimulation is too intense for my penis that's sensitive after just coming. In her hands, it convulses over and over.
3717:My waist trembles in pleasure, my vision turns white, and I can't think of anything else anymore.
3718:ShinkÅgUgh, Shirene... Haaa... Can't!Åh
3719:ShireneÅgDon't hold back. Hurry and come... I'll catch it all.Åh
3720:ShireneÅgIf I grip you tightly like this... Ngh, aah... now!Åh
3721:She takes a strong grasp on the base of my penis and gives me one smooth stroke to finish me off.
3722:My body shudders in shock, overcome with a desire to ejaculate, and shoots out more semen.
3723:ShireneÅgNgh, aaah... Amazing, even more than before. It smells stronger too...Åh
3724:ShinkÅgUgh, kuh...Åh
3725:As my body trembles, I release semen for Shirene, leaving not a drop behind.
3726:Shirene stares intently while doing her best to catch all of it in her hand.
3727:ShireneÅgNgh, Now I can... become much stronger... thanks to this.Åh
3728:ShireneÅgBut for right now... This smells amazingly good... and my head won't stop spinning.Åh
3729:ShinkÅgGuh, haaa... What's going on with you..Åh
3730:Shirene practically sounds drunk. Confused and panting for breath, I ask her what's the matter.
3731:Aroused by the smell of my semen, it doesn't look like she's listening to me though.
3732:ShireneÅgNow I just have to...Åh
3733:After staring at the semen in her hand for awhile, she slowly brings it to her mouth and begins licking it off.
3734:ShireneÅgMmmpch... Mmmnn... Mmmnspst...Åh
3735:ShireneÅgIt tastes rather strange, and it's getting caught in my throat too... This stuff is hard to drink.Åh
3736:I can hear her slurping my cum as she forces it down, her face expressing a vacant, enthralled look the whole time.
3737:ShireneÅgIt's not too bad though...Åh
3738:ShireneÅgI can see why other monsters like it so much. This stuff could get addicting...Åh
3739:All I can do is watch Shirene in dumbfounded amazement as she talks to herself.
3740:Eventually she finishes drinking. She seems like she's stuck in a trance as she lets out a sigh.
3741:ShireneÅgMmmpch, haaa... That was good. Now I can be strong too.Åh
3742:ShinkÅgGuh, is that... so...Åh
3743:ShireneÅgHehe, I'm much obliged to you too, of course. If we get another chance, I'd love to have some more...Åh
3744:ShinkÅg...Åh
3745:She leaves me unable to move for awhile as I lie in shock at hearing her amorous voice at the end there.
3746:Several days later, after refining the plan and honing her skills, Shirene challenges Vera.
3747:For her part, Vera answers with a smile, her face overflowing with confidence.
3748:Up until now, she's always defeated Shirene without breaking a sweat, after all.
3749:However, this is a whole new Shirene. If she's expecting this to be a repeat of past performances, she's in for some pain.
3750:VeraÅgHeheh. Since you went to the trouble of calling me out here, I assume you have no problem with making this duel official?Åh
3751:ShireneÅgNot at all. We're finally going to have a serious match today.Åh
3752:VeraÅgOooh, is that right? If you think that's possible, I want to see you try.Åh
3753:ShireneÅgOf course. That's why I'm here!!Åh
3754:VeraÅg...whoa!?Åh
3755:Before she's even done talking, Shirene swings her pole in a surprise attack.
3756:Vera takes a quick step backwards to dodge, but not without a look of astonishment on her face.
3757:However, as though she predicted Vera's reaction, Shirene wastes no time in closing the distance and pressing the attack.
3758:VeraÅgGrrr... A sneak attack? You aren't worthy of being called a knight!Åh
3759:ShireneÅgIsn't there no such thing as a sneak attack in a duel?!Åh
3760:VeraÅgHehe, ahahaha! Yes! Exactly! You finally get it!Åh
3761:ShireneÅgAs always... You're taking this too lightly!Åh
3762:VeraÅgNaturally! Those predictable attacks of yours still aren't going to hit me!Åh
3763:With a fierce smile, Vera safely avoids Shirene's incessant swings from all directions.
3764:Her attacks look the same as always, but I know they're nothing more than preparation for her next move.
3765:RinÅgUmm, Professor Shink? Is it working? This doesn't really look any different...Åh
3766:CometÅgShe won't prevail over Vera like this. Is there something new?Åh
3767:ShinkÅgWatch and learn.Åh
3768:I grin at the concerned spectators then turn my attention back to Shirene.
3769:Vera has gotten used to the pattern by now and has begun predicting and defending attacks before Shirene swings.
3770:Any second now...
3771:ShireneÅgHaaaaa!!Åh
3772:VeraÅgToo easy! Haven't I told you that your attacks can't hit me?!Åh
3773:ShireneÅg.........Åh
3774:Predicting a blow aimed at her head from above, Vera raises one of her feet to intercept.
3775:At that moment, Shirene's mouth opens wide in a broad grin... and Vera's face twists in pain.
3776:VeraÅg...eek!?Åh
3777:RinÅgAah!Åh
3778:CometÅgAmazing.Åh
3779:BibiÅgOooh, what have we here. Things have gotten interesting now.Åh
3780:ShireneÅgHehe, I hit you. The first of many to come!Åh
3781:VeraÅgWhaa... You changed the trajectory?Åh
3782:Flustered, Vera stares at Shirene in disbelief.
3783:It's good that she landed a blow, but it doesn't look like it did any damage.
3784:ShireneÅgTch, I didn't get a clean hit. I knew it wouldn't be that easy.Åh
3785:ShireneÅgBut... I've got plenty more of those!!Åh
3786:VeraÅgUgh, not bad!Åh
3787:Shirene takes a quick breath, and without giving Vera time to recover, resumes her resolute attack.
3788:Unlike the predictable attacks of the past, she mixes in feints to form a relentless onslaught of blows.
3789:When I think she's attacking left, she attacks right, and attacks from the left give the impression of coming from the right.
3790:Shirene looks completely in command of her body's movements. Vera, having a hard time defending, grimaces.
3791:VeraÅgKuu! Your attacks have become extremely unpleasant, you know!Åh
3792:ShireneÅgOh, are you displeased?Åh
3793:VeraÅgOn the contrary! This is good! It's finally fun!!Åh
3794:ShireneÅgThen stop going easy on me. Show me your strength!!Åh
3795:VeraÅgHoo!! That's for me to decide!Åh
3796:Shirene's determined attacks continue to drive Vera back.
3797:However, whereas Vera looked like she was having a hard time defending earlier, her composure is beginning to slowly return.
3798:Has she learned Shirene's new style already? Her ability to adapt on the fly is incredible...
3799:RinÅgProfessor Shink, I'm getting the feeling that beating her is nearly impossible.Åh
3800:CometÅgVera only had difficulties to start with. She's already adapted and settled down.Åh
3801:BibiÅgWell, well. Shirene has no chance of winning now, or does she have something else up her sleeve?Åh
3802:ShinkÅgI think you'll enjoy finding out.Åh
3803:To tell the truth, there is one trick remaining for Shirene.
3804:It's the kind of move that only works once, though.
3805:Well, that's the definition of a trick anyway, I suppose.
3806:ShireneÅgEnough already! Accept defeat!!Åh
Bleh. "Drop dead!!" but she doesn't want Vera dead. Hard to translate "Fall down!" or "Be defeated!"
3807:VeraÅgHa, what a joke! You've gone crazy if you think you can beat me like this!!Åh
3808:ShireneÅgWe'll see about that. Come on, I'm not done yet!Åh
3809:While screaming, Shirene advances closer and closer to Vera.
3810:She aims all her attacks as though leading Vera to a specific spot...
3811:ShinkÅgAll right, this is her last chance.Åh
3812:VeraÅgHaha, pretty good! I'm really... aha, having fun!!Åh
3813:ShireneÅgYou don't have time to be laughing! I'm going to take you out!Åh
3814:VeraÅgYou're kidding! I'm not going to let such a fun time end...!?Åh
3815:ShinkÅgIt worked!!Åh
3816:As she laughs in glee, Vera suddenly loses her balance and trips.
3817:Before the fight began, Shirene and I dug a pit there. Even Vera shouldn't be able to get out quickly.
3818:ShireneÅgHere I come!!!Åh
3819:Seizing her opportunity, Shirene kicks a few rocks underfoot and thrusts her pole forward.
3820:With the rocks and pole together, she strikes at nine places simultaneously. This is it!
3821:ShireneÅgHuh?Åh
3822:ShinkÅgWha...!?Åh
3823:Vera took Shirene's attack. I could see that much.
3824:However, Vera isn't there anymore. Instead, Shirene is the one on the ground.
3825:RinÅgEh, eeeh!? Wh-what happened!?Åh
3826:CometÅgI have no idea. Shirene just suddenly collapsed. It's like she cheated time.Åh
It looks like time was cut off/out
3827:BibiÅgOh my. Heheh, that wasn't bad. Definitely worthy of praise.Åh
3828:ShinkÅg......Åh
3829:All of us are frozen in surprise staring at the same spot.
3830:Even Shirene isn't getting up, as if she's wondering what the hell just happened herself.
3831:ShinkÅgWait, can you even stand, Shirene?Åh
3832:VeraÅgProbably not? It's been forever since I had to hit someone seriously, after all.Åh
3833:ShinkÅg!?Åh
3834:RinÅgEh, behind us? Wh-when did you get there!?Åh
3835:CometÅgDid she stop time...?Åh
3836:VeraÅgAhahaha! Don't be silly. There's no way to stop time or anything like that.Åh
3837:VeraÅgI just moved. With everything I've got though.Åh
3838:BibiÅgThat's even more absurd. I'm more satisfied with the time stopping theory.Åh
3839:ShinkÅgDefinitely.Åh
3840:The distance between us and Shirene is so far...
3841:VeraÅgAnyway, did you teach her all that, Shink?Åh
3842:ShinkÅgWhat did I say about using... oh nevermind. Yeah, kind of.Åh
3843:VeraÅgHmmmm... I see.Åh
3844:Vera appears to be thinking something as she looks me up and down, scrutinizing me.
3845:It's honestly creeping me out...
3846:RinÅgProfessor Shink! Shouldn't you be checking on Shirene right now?!Åh
3847:CometÅgVera, what did you do to Shirene. I'm worried that she hasn't gotten up yet.Åh
3848:VeraÅgOh, there's no need to be worried. She's hardly weak.Åh
3849:VeraÅgAnd since when do you guys worry about others, anyway? Is that also thanks to Shink?Åh
3850:ShinkÅgNo, I don't think so.Åh
3851:VeraÅgHmmm, okay then. Shall we head on over and console the loser? You, come with me.Åh
Loser = depressed guy, loser might not be appropriate
3852:ShinkÅg...!?Åh
3853:The moment she finished talking, Rin and the others vanished from my sight.
3854:I take a surprised look around and see Vera smiling at the fallen Shirene.
3855:Did she just carry me over here?
3856:VeraÅgHow ya doin', Miss spaced out?Åh
Have to do better than that.
3857:ShireneÅgAh, aaah... Guess I lost...Åh
3858:VeraÅgDo you know how many times you were hit?Åh
3859:ShireneÅg...ten.Åh
3860:VeraÅgRight. I struck with you every leg and hand I've got.Åh
3861:ShireneÅgHands... you said?Åh
3862:VeraÅgYep, my hands. You understand what that means, don't you?Åh
3863:Shirene's eyes open wide when she hears that, alternating between looking at Vera's face and her own wounds.
3864:Her body quivers and tears begin streaming down her cheeks.
3865:ShireneÅgUngh... ah, ugh...!Åh
3866:ShinkÅgH-hold on, what's wrong!?Åh
3867:VeraÅgAha! Shirene Centoru, I recognize you as my rival.Åh
FIXME probably changing that name at some point
3868:VeraÅgTrain hard and come after me again, using any methods you can. I await your challenge.Åh
3869:VeraÅgI won't hold back against you either!Åh
3870:ShireneÅgUgh... of course! I will defeat you... no matter what!Åh
3871:VeraÅgHehe, give me your best shot. As if I could ever lose!Åh
3872:With the challenge accepted, Vera dexterously extends a leg to help Shirene to her feet.
3873:Once she's up, Vera glances at Shirene and smiles. As though everything that needed to be said has been, she leaves. 
3874:Despite how absurd and reckless Vera is, I can't help but think she's kind of cool too...
3875:ShireneÅg...ugh.Åh
3876:ShinkÅgWhy so glum? This turned out well. You got her to fight you seriously.Åh
3877:ShireneÅgI suppose. It's all because of you... so thanks.Åh
3878:ShinkÅgNo, I just thought up the plan. It succeeded because of the strength of your feelings, Shirene.Åh
3879:ShireneÅgStill... If you hadn't helped me, those feelings wouldn't have gotten through.Åh
3880:ShinkÅgYeah? I'm glad to have done my part then.Åh
3881:Figuring that she doesn't want me seeing her cry, I avert my gaze and blush in shyness.
3882:At any rate, it's wonderful that Shirene's feelings got through to Vera.
Maybe this is overly literal
3883:ShinkÅg...!?Åh
3884:As I reflect on the situation, I feel a sense of warmth embrace me from behind.
3885:I instinctively try to get away, but I'm being hugged too tightly to move.
3886:ShinkÅgSh-Shirene... What are...!Åh
3887:ShireneÅgI'm sorry, just give me a minute of this...Åh
3888:ShinkÅg......Åh
3889:I'm not overly embarrassed to have Shirene burying her face in my back and crying so I simply stand there silently.
3890:RinÅgAaaaah! Shirene! What are you doing!!Åh
3891:CometÅgAn unexpected ambush. From the least likely of sources too. God damn!Åh
3892:ShinkÅgWhoa!? Why all the yelling!Åh
3893:RinÅgL-let him go! You're making me jea... Nevermind, just don't do that!Åh
3894:CometÅgPromiscuity between teacher and student... I smell a crime afoot. Decisive action!Åh
3895:ShireneÅgWh-what are you accusing me of! I'm just thanking him!!Åh
3896:RinÅgThanking! You're thanking him!? Like this!?Åh
3897:CometÅgThanking him with my body... How obscene.Åh
3898:ShireneÅgY-y-you know there's no way I'd do that!Åh
3899:ShinkÅgH-hey now...Åh
3900:I'm left in a panic of confusion at having our heartfelt atmosphere broken up by their squabbling.
3901:On the bright side, the ruckus seems to be curing Shirene of her depression.
"Filling in her gutter"
3902:Thinking about it that way puts a smile on my face at least.
3903:RinÅgProfessor Shink! What are you smiling at?! Do you really like Shirene embracing you!?Åh
3904:CometÅgHe's hiding it! I object! Men should be openly lecherous!!Åh
3905:ShinkÅgWhat the hell are you talking about!?Åh
3906:ShireneÅgDamn it! Let me be emotional for a minute here!!Åh
3907:Having endured enough of their unrestrained feelings, Shirene finally explodes.
3908:They're definitely boisterous though, but I guess that's a perk of student life?
3909:BibiÅgOh my, haha... Now things are really getting interesting.Åh
3910:VeraÅgYou're not going to join them?Åh
3911:BibiÅgYou're kidding. I'm not as easily impressed as them.Åh
"My heart isn't open to the extent of being able to enter into that."
3912:VeraÅgI see, but you'd better be careful. Shink is a real charmer.Åh
3913:BibiÅgOoh? What makes you say that?Åh
3914:VeraÅgMy intuition, and my intuition is never wrong.Åh
3915:BibiÅgIntuition, huh... Hehe, so what are you going to do next? Travel somewhere new?Åh
3916:VeraÅgUmm, I was going to, but things are so fun around here I'm thinking about sticking around.Åh
3917:BibiÅgOooh, because of our charmer?Åh
3918:VeraÅgThat's a possibility. Of course, I won't be swayed like those three.Åh
3919:BibiÅgHahaha. Maybe I should repeat your own advice back to you.Åh
3920:VeraÅgNo need. There's no man cooler than my father.Åh
3921:BibiÅgI see, I see. At any rate, it looks like things are going to get even more fun than they already are.Åh
3922:VeraÅgSure does.Åh
3923:RinÅgCome on, I said let him go!!Åh
3924:CometÅgThat's right. Let me take her place!Åh
3925:ShireneÅgI refuse! Do you two just want to get in my way!?Åh
3926:ShinkÅgDammit, calm down!!Åh
3927:ShireneÅgVera! Don't you steal from me!!Åh
3928:VeraÅgHa! It's your own fault if you leave me an opening!!Åh
3929:ShireneÅgHow dare you!Åh
3930:ShinkÅgSigh... Not this again...Åh
3931:As I head into the dining hall for some breakfast, I glance over my shoulder at the sound of yelling.
3932:As I should have expected, it's Shirene and Vera at it again.
3933:The explosive atmosphere hasn't come back since that day, but now they're constantly arguing about something.
3934:RinÅgAh, good morning, Professor Shink.Åh
3935:CometÅgMornin'Åh
3936:ShinkÅgHey. So what set them off today?Åh
3937:RinÅgSigh. Just the usual things, I guess.Åh
3938:CometÅgA scramble for side dishes. This is a mealtime war. Is there any conflict more pointless?Åh
Bleh
3939:ShinkÅgWhy don't you stop them then?Åh
3940:CometÅgI'll pass on getting caught up in their battles.Åh
3941:ShinkÅgCan't blame you for that...Åh
3942:I shrug at Comet and take a seat far away from them, hoping to avoid a similar fate.
3943:Getting involved with those two would be nothing but a pain in the ass.
3944:KyuteÅgThat's not right, Shink. You're a teacher. You can't think like that.Åh
3945:ShinkÅgHow do you know what I'm thinking?Åh
3946:KyuteÅgHeheh, I can read it on your face.Åh
3947:ShinkÅgYou've got to be kidding...Åh
3948:I've always considered my poker face to be a strong point. Can Kyute really tell?
3949:MiritaÅgEnough of this. Go put a stop to this mess between Shirene and Vera.Åh
3950:VeraÅgI will not! Retreat is not a word in my dictionary!!Åh
Apparently Japanese uses that phrase too (similar at least)
3951:ShireneÅgWell I'm not in the wrong here! Just give it up!Åh
3952:MiritaÅgAaah... So you still won't listen to me.Åh
3953:ShinkÅg......Åh
3954:Mirita is a pain every day too. I wish she'd give it up.
3955:KyuteÅgShink, stop eating like you don't have a care in the world and go do something about them.Åh
3956:ShinkÅgYou're asking the impossible. If there were something I could do, I would have done it a long time ago.Åh
3957:KyuteÅgThey'll listen to you. Shouldn't they stop if you tell them to?Åh
3958:ShinkÅgYou're crazy if you think it's that easy...Åh
3959:First of all, there's no way those bull-headed girls would stop because of something I tell them.
3960:RinÅgBut Professor Shink, I bet you of all people can do it.Åh
3961:CometÅgMuh, I don't want to admit it, but she has a point.Åh
3962:ShinkÅgEven you two think so?Åh
3963:I'm glad they have confidence in me, but it feels like I'm being shoved into a dangerous situation.
3964:KyuteÅgAnyway, please go stop them before this turns into a full-scale war.Åh
3965:ShinkÅgIf you're so concerned, why don't you?Åh
3966:KyuteÅgPoor me, I'm just a frail woman. Good thing there's a man here.Åh
3967:ShinkÅgAnd the real reason?Åh
3968:KyuteÅgAren't you more likely to bring this to a peaceful resolution?Åh
FIXME is this wrong?
3969:ShinkÅg...wish me luck.Åh
3970:I wish she'd stop smiling and fluttering her wings.
3971:She's dangerous, or should I say she thinks too recklessly. Despite being half human, maybe it's due to her monster blood.
FIXME Is he talking about Kyute or Vera? Probably too long and bad anyway
3972:ShinkÅgHey Shirene, Vera. Come on, give it a rest.Åh
3973:ShireneÅgUgh, Shink? Did you come over here just to stop us?Åh
3974:ShinkÅgSomething like that. Keep it down during meals. Breakfast time is almost over anyway.Åh
3975:ShireneÅgI'd rather not, but fine, if you say so.Åh
3976:ShinkÅgOh?Åh
3977:Well that was a surprise. I never imagined she'd listen to me that easily.
3978:VeraÅgDamn, you're no fun. I was hoping we were about to fight.Åh
3979:MiritaÅgVera, that's dangerous!Åh
3980:ShinkÅgSeriously. Have some consideration for the people around you.Åh
3981:VeraÅgHuh? Everyone is enjoying watching us.Åh
3982:VeraÅgLook, that group over there is even betting on who's going to win the fight.Åh
3983:ShinkÅgWhat??Åh
3984:Hey now, students shouldn't be gambling.
3985:Student 1ÅgGah! Vera, that's not nice telling on us.Åh
3986:Student 2ÅgYeah really! I make good money off this!Åh
3987:KyuteÅgOoh, you're at it again. This is interesting news to hear.Åh
3988:Student 1ÅgGah, Professor Kyute!?Åh
3989:Student 2ÅgAh, ahaha... We-we're sorry, Kyute.Åh
Calls her Kyute-chan
3990:KyuteÅgThat's Professor Kyute to you! You two, come with me.Åh
3991:StudentsÅgNooooo!!Åh
3992:ShinkÅgSorry...Åh
3993:Kyute carries off the students who were betting on the fight without me having to get involved.
3994:It's all well and good to cut loose sometimes, but they shouldn't take it that far.
3995:ShinkÅgShirene, Vera, keep it down if you don't want to suffer a similar fate.Åh
3996:ShireneÅgAh, yeah... I got it.Åh
3997:VeraÅgUheee, Kyute is so scary...Åh
Older sister Kyute
3998:MiritaÅgVera, just don't do anything to make her mad.Åh
3999:VeraÅgYeah, yeah. That goes for you too, Mirita.Åh
Or is she saying that Mirita is also scary? FIXME I guess, or maybe my translation is ambiguous enough to cover both
4000:Probably thanks to Kyute's fearsome display, the commotion seems to be dying down.
4001:Well, I'd better go prepare for class before it gets too late.
4002:ShinkÅgWait a second...Åh
4003:VeraÅgHuh? What is it?Åh
4004:ShinkÅgAh, nothing. I just noticed that Bibi wasn't around this morning is all.Åh
4005:Normally she'd be close by watching the shit Vera stirs up for fun, but I didn't see her today.
4006:RinÅgNow that you mention it, I didn't see her either.Åh
4007:CometÅgIt's been a few months since we got new class members. I was thinking it was about time.Åh
4008:RinÅgAh, you're right. It really has been that long...Åh
4009:ShireneÅgWhat are you two talking about?Åh
4010:RinÅgUhh, you'll figure it out sooner or later.Åh
4011:ShinkÅg...?Åh
4012:The serial grade repeaters? Sounds like they know something...
Rephrase
4013:MiritaÅgWell, you see... Exams are coming up soon, right?Åh
4014:ShinkÅgHmm? Yeah, they are.Åh
4015:VeraÅgAnd there's your answer. It's about this time she practically stops going to class.Åh
4016:ShinkÅgYou mean she's skipping?Åh
4017:CometÅgPretty much.Åh
4018:RinÅgWell... yeah.Åh
4019:ShinkÅgWonderful...Åh
4020:She must really hate exams to start skipping class when they draw near.
4021:VeraÅgShe's probably sleeping soundly in her room right now.Åh
4022:ShinkÅgSigh. Guess I've got to go wake her up. You girls head on to the classroom.Åh
4023:RinÅgAre you sure that's safe?Åh
4024:ShinkÅgSafe? What's so dangerous about it?Åh
4025:MiritaÅgWell... It's just that-- mmmngh!?Åh
4026:VeraÅgWe'll leave Bibi up to you then! Off to class everyone!Åh
4027:CometÅgStop that... Don't pull. Let me go. Get your tentacles off...Åh
4028:Vera forcefully drags the others out of the dining hall. It sounded like they wanted to tell me something...
4029:But wow, she was strong enough to pull all of them by herself.
4030:ShinkÅgOh well, I don't have time to waste on trivial matters like that.Åh
4031:Now where was Bibi's room...
4032:ShinkÅgBibi, are you awake? I'm coming in, all right?Åh
4033:Having arrived at Bibi's room, I announce myself just in case and enter.
4034:I feel awkward barging into a student's room uninvited, but I can't let her hide in here and cut class.
As if Shink didn't already do this with Rin.
4035:ShinkÅgHey... Oh, she really is still asleep.Åh
4036:I look over to her bed to see Bibi sleeping soundly, unaware of my presence.
4037:That isn't the look of someone unable to wake up, but rather someone who has no interest in doing so.
4038:It's always hard to wake people who are like that...
4039:ShinkÅgHey, Bibi! Rise and shine!Åh
4040:BibiÅgUngh, not so loud. Sorry, but I don't feel like getting up. Just let me sleep.Åh
4041:ShinkÅgIdiot! You can't start skipping class just because exams are coming up!Åh
4042:BibiÅgTaking exams is a lot of stress for no possible gain. I don't see any point in it.Åh
4043:ShinkÅgYou'll be held back! Do you even remember how many times that's already happened to you!?Åh
4044:BibiÅgThree times. That's one thing I can't forget.Åh
4045:ShinkÅgThen take care that it doesn't happen again!Åh
4046:BibiÅgNo thanks. I'll be held back if I want to, and no one has the right to tell me I can't.Åh
4047:BibiÅgAlso, if that's your only complaint, Rin, Comet, Mirita, and Vera have repeated the year too.Åh
4048:BibiÅgYou should be talking to them, not just me.Åh
4049:ShinkÅgLook, they're not the issue here.Åh
4050:I let out an exasperated sigh in response to Bibi's attempt to refocus my attention.
4051:She doesn't show any indication of getting up though. She isn't even stirring at all.
4052:ShinkÅgSigh... What am I going to do with you...Åh
4053:BibiÅgJust leave me alone. Head to class and don't worry about me.Åh
4054:ShinkÅgI don't think I can do that...Åh
4055:Damn, I'm getting nowhere with her. There's got to be something...
4056:Head MaidÅgExcuse us.Åh
4057:ShinkÅgWhoa!?Åh
4058:While lost in my own thoughts trying to think of some way to motivate Bibi, I suddenly hear a voice from behind.
4059:I leap into the air and spin around in surprise to see several monster girls from the bee family.
4060:Head MaidÅgProfessor Shink Celestite, I presume?Åh
4061:ShinkÅgYeah, that's me...Åh
4062:Head MaidÅgI deeply apologize for the trouble Miss Bibi has caused you.Åh
4063:ShinkÅgUh, no it's all right.Åh
4064:Head MaidÅgPlease leave Miss Bibi to us. We'll make sure she gets to class on time.Åh
4065:ShinkÅgOh? Well, thanks for offering, but...Åh
4066:From appearances, it looks like they work for Bibi. Aren't they going to be on her side then?
4067:I'd love to have the help, but are they really going to bring her to class?
4068:Head MaidÅgHmm, it seems that you doubt us. Please wait outside then. She'll be right out.Åh
4069:ShinkÅgAll right then...Åh
4070:I can't complain about that, I guess.
4071:If she doesn't come out, I can always yell through the door at least.
4072:ShinkÅgOkay, thanks.Åh
4073:Head MaidÅgGlad to help. Now then...Åh
4074:The head maid makes a well-practiced bow, and all of them swarm around Bibi's bed.
4075:BibiÅgHey, what are you doing! Stop that! Cut it out!!Åh
4076:ShinkÅg...I'll be in the courtyard.Åh
4077:It looks like the maids are the ones with power over Bibi. My earlier assumption was way off.
4078:I shut the door behind me and leave, hearing screams from behind as I walk down the hall.
4079:ShinkÅgThey're sure taking awhile...Åh
4080:I need to hurry and get to class, but Bibi still hasn't shown up.
4081:Maybe she was too much for them after all.
4082:ShinkÅgOh well. Guess I have to...Åh
4083:Head MaidÅgSorry to keep you waiting.Åh
4084:ShinkÅgGood timing. I was just about to...Åh
4085:ShinkÅgWhaaaa!?Åh
4086:Hearing a voice from behind, I turn around to see Bibi and her maids.
4087:It's nice that she's out of her room, but...
4088:BibiÅgThis is ridiculous. Do you really want me to attend class this badly?Åh
4089:Head MaidÅgOf course. If you don't graduate soon, it will reflect poorly on us too.Åh
4090:BibiÅgTch. What a pain. Aaah, I'm still so tired...Åh
4091:ShinkÅgW-w-what the hell is that!?Åh
4092:BibiÅgMmm? Oh, if it isn't the professor. I'm surprised to see you here.Åh
4093:ShinkÅgLet's ignore me for a minute. What's with that thing...Åh
4094:BibiÅgIs it not obvious? What a pain. Hey, explain it to him.Åh
4095:Head MaidÅgYes ma'am. This is Miss Bibi's personal palanquin.Åh
Maybe just use 'litter'
4096:ShinkÅgI can see that!Åh
4097:Head MaidÅgWell then, there's nothing more to explain.Åh
4098:BibiÅgIndeed. How about it, professor? Say the word and I'll give you a ride.Åh
4099:ShinkÅgI'll pass.Åh
4100:No thanks. There's no way I'm going to intentionally make myself conspicuous by getting on that thing.
4101:All the other students have to be staring...
4102:ShinkÅg...not in this direction at all?Åh
4103:They must be used to seeing this by now.
4104:BibiÅgOoh? I wasn't expecting to be refused. Huhu, you really are interesting.Åh
4105:ShinkÅgNo, I'm just not interested in riding...Åh
4106:BibiÅgHehe, no need to be humble. Even the hard to please Rin, Comet, and Shirene can't resist. It's OK to be proud of yourself.Åh
4107:ShinkÅgI don't know about that...Åh
4108:It's not like I did anything special. It's only natural for a teacher to refuse.
4109:So it's kind of embarrassing to be told I should be proud for it.
4110:BibiÅgSo modest. Do you really not want a ride, though? You're going to be late.Åh
ñ≥ó~ is "someone who doesn't want/covet things" Hard to pick a word that fits.
4111:ShinkÅgWhose fault do you think that is? Whatever, go on ahead of me.Åh
4112:I turn down her offer for a second time and wave her on ahead.
4113:I'd honestly rather her get down and walk, but I won't waste my breath.
4114:Bearer BeeÅgHey! Human!!Åh
4115:ShinkÅgHuh?Åh
4116:I start to walk off lost in thought when one of the bee maids carrying Bibi yells and glares at me.
4117:What's with her? Did I do something?
4118:Bearer BeeÅgWho do you think you are to decline Miss Bibi's invitation? What's with your attitude?Åh
4119:Bearer BeeÅgThat's right! You're acting rather impertinent for a mere human!!Åh
4120:ShinkÅg...Oh, it's that.Åh
4121:It's been awhile since I've heard things like that.
4122:After a few months at the academy they stopped saying that to me. It actually makes me kind of nostalgic.
4123:Bearer BeeÅgWhat an attitude! Audacious human!Åh
4124:Bearer BeeÅgYeah! If Bibi asks you...Åh
4125:BibiÅgShut up and don't act uppity!Åh
4126:Bearer BeeÅgEeek!?Åh
4127:BibiÅgWho gave you permission to open your mouths anyway? Keep your idiotic comments to yourselves and walk.Åh
4128:Bearer BeeÅgBut!Åh
4129:BibiÅg......Åh
4130:They try to protest but are silenced under Bibi's piercing stare.
4131:I had heard she was a candidate for queen. Seeing this, I can understand why.
Bee queen, not really THE Queen I guess?
4132:She has a natural presence and impressive charisma.
4133:BibiÅgTch, you all make me sick. Speed it up.Åh
4134:ShinkÅgH-hey!Åh
4135:BibiÅgYou'd better hurry too, professor. Or hitch a ride?Åh
4136:ShinkÅgNot happening no matter how many times you ask.Åh
4137:BibiÅgHehe, then I'll wait for my next chance. Huhu, you're definitely an interesting human.Åh
4138:ShinkÅgDon't hold your breath for that chance...Åh
4139:Bibi stares down at me like a predator choosing her prey. Once she's gone, I sigh.
4140:I've got a feeling this isn't the end of my troubles with her...
4141:ShinkÅgNow, looking at this...Åh
4142:BibiÅgZzz...zzz... Mmmmn...Åh
4143:ShinkÅg......Åh
4144:Bibi was fine when class started, but it didn't take long for her to fall back asleep.
4145:I certainly can't continue teaching with her like this...
4146:MiritaÅgBibi, Bibi... You've got to pay attention.Åh
4147:BibiÅgMmm? Don't worry, it's fine. The professor won't mind...Åh
4148:ShinkÅg.........Åh
4149:What makes her think that? There's no way I'm going to let her sleep.
4150:ShinkÅgHey Bibi, wake up. I'm going to make you stay after if you don't.Åh
4151:BibiÅgYou're too loud. I'm tired, leave me alone.Åh
4152:ShinkÅgHey, look here...Åh
4153:CometÅgJust leave her be. She'll be the one suffering for it.Åh
4154:ShireneÅgExactly. There's no point teaching to someone who doesn't want to learn in the first place.Åh
4155:RinÅgThat's right. Professor Shink, ignore her and please continue.Åh
4156:ShinkÅgI can't do that...Åh
4157:What heartless friends! Well, I can understand what they're saying, but...
4158:BibiÅgMmm? Yeah. Leave me be and continue class... Zzz...Åh
4159:ShinkÅgSigh. Why is she so tired all the sudden? She was wide awake a minute ago.Åh
4160:VeraÅgOh? You're right. That's rather unusual too.Åh
4161:ShinkÅgIt is?Åh
4162:VeraÅgYeah! It's weird that Bibi was awake during class in the first place.Åh
4163:RinÅgNow that you mention it, that's true. She's always asleep in class.Åh
4164:BibiÅgIt's the first class of the day, after all. I was just observing the situation.Åh
4165:ShinkÅgSince you're awake now, stay that way.Åh
4166:So in other words, after watching me for a bit, she come to the conclusion that I would let her sleep?
4167:She greatly underestimated me. What teacher would let that happen...
4168:BibiÅgI refuse. And with that, good night.Åh
4169:ShinkÅgH-hey!Åh
4170:Despite waking up to explain herself, she instantly fell right back to sleep.
4171:Even worse, no amount of shaking or anything else is getting her up this time.
4172:ShinkÅgSigh, oh well. Someone please let Bibi copy your notes after class.Åh
4173:MiritaÅgAll right, I will.Åh
4174:ShinkÅgThanks Mirita. Moving on...Åh
4175:I don't like it, but I can't afford to delay class any longer over her.
4176:I'm going to have to do something about this though...
4177:ShinkÅgThat's all for today. Exams are coming up next week so study hard everyone.Åh
4178:VeraÅgYes! C'mon, let's go have some fun girls!Åh
4179:ShinkÅgWere you even listening?Åh
4180:VeraÅgMmn? I don't wanna. I don't really need to study anyway.Åh
4181:ShinkÅgEven so, don't drag your classmates down.Åh
4182:CometÅgI don't mind. My grades are always average.Åh
4183:VeraÅgComet knows what's up!Åh
4184:ShinkÅgDon't listen to her. You should set your sights higher than merely average.Åh
4185:If possible, any teacher would love for all his students to aim to do their best.
4186:CometÅgWhy? I don't see how getting good grades on exams matters.Åh
4187:ShinkÅg...really?Åh
4188:RinÅgProfessor Shink! I'm trying my best! *Cough*...!Åh
4189:ShinkÅgGood. Make sure you're taking care of your body too though.Åh
4190:It would be a real shame if she got stick and had to miss exams.
4191:The mere fact that there are no makeup exams makes me concerned about how this academy is run.
4192:BibiÅgZzz...zzz... Mmmn...Åh
4193:ShinkÅgSigh, someone wake Bibi up before you go.Åh
4194:I spare a glance at the sleeping Bibi and sigh as I leave the classroom.
4195:I need to focus on the exam, but I also need to learn more about the students themselves.
4196:I want to believe that none of them will skip, but who knows...
4197:KyuteÅgI see. So you want to look at everyone's grades.Åh
4198:ShinkÅgYeah. I wasn't worried about them so much before, but I've become concerned lately.Åh
4199:KyuteÅgI understand. Wait right here and I'll go dig them up.Åh
4200:ShinkÅgThanks a lot.Åh
4201:During my lunch break, I pay a visit to Kyute to take a look at my students' grades.
4202:I told them to study after class, but it didn't seem effective. If I see their grades, maybe I can better focus my efforts.
4203:KyuteÅgHere you are. I don't know how much use they will be to you though.Åh
4204:ShinkÅgOh? Why is that?Åh
4205:KyuteÅgWell, take a look and see.Åh
4206:Kyute hands over the transcripts with a strained laugh. I give her a quizzical look and open them up.
4207:Inside, everyone's past results are recorded in painstaking detail.
4208:ShinkÅgRin... It doesn't look like she actually takes her exams very often.Åh
4209:KyuteÅgYeah... Nothing we can do when she's sick, but it does seem like she gave up trying along the way.Åh
4210:ShinkÅgHmm... Well, her grades when she does take them aren't bad at all. She's a fine student.Åh
4211:ShinkÅgVera... Nothing but perfect marks.Åh
4212:Wow, is there anything she isn't good at?
4213:KyuteÅgThere's no need to worry about Vera. She'd graduate with flying colors if she didn't take so many trips.Åh
4214:ShinkÅgShe definitely needs to pay more attention to attendance.Åh
4215:KyuteÅgYes. I took my eyes off her for just a second during spring break and she disappeared...Åh
4216:ShinkÅg......Åh
4217:Keeping tabs on her even during breaks is a tall order for sure.
4218:ShinkÅgThere don't seem to be any problems with Mirita either, and Shirene... Wait, is this for real?Åh
4219:I have to reread Shirene's transcripts twice to make sure I'm not seeing things.
4220:In every subject, her grades are far below the average.
4221:ShinkÅgShe's such a harder worker, though. I never would have imagined her grades were this bad.Åh
4222:KyuteÅgAh, Shirene... It's not that she's dumb or anything, it's just...Åh
4223:ShinkÅg...just?Åh
4224:KyuteÅgHow should I put this... Once she gets stuck on a problem, she won't move on until she solves it.Åh
4225:ShinkÅgAah, she's one of those types?Åh
4226:She must run out of time without finishing much of the exam because she won't skip problems.
4227:Is she too much of a perfectionist, or just stubborn? Either way she probably wants to solve every problem. 
4228:ShinkÅgSo should I focus on that? It seems like she's become more open-minded in her way own lately, at least.Åh
4229:KyuteÅgI have noticed a change in her lately, too. Thanks to you, I bet.Åh
4230:ShinkÅgHa ha ha, don't know if I can take credit for that.Åh
4231:I laugh off Kyute's praise and move on to the next page.
4232:At the end of the transcripts, I see the two students I'm most concerned about.
4233:ShinkÅgWell, I should have expected this.Åh
4234:KyuteÅgAh, Comet and Bibi?Åh
4235:ShinkÅgYeah... This isn't a joke, is it?Åh
4236:KyuteÅgSadly no. The transcripts are all correct.Åh
4237:ShinkÅgThought so...Åh
4238:I sigh in astonishment and look back down at the page.
4239:I almost want to cry at seeing the long column of goose eggs that comprise Bibi's transcript.
4240:ShinkÅgIt's actually kind of amazing to see a page of nothing but zeroes.Åh
4241:KyuteÅgYeah. Not only is she poor when it comes to studying, but she sleeps during her exams too.Åh
4242:ShinkÅgShe really just shows up and sleeps during them?Åh
ñ{ìñÇ…éÛÇØÇƒÇÈÇæÇØÇ»ÇÃÇ© ???
4243:This is incredibly sad. Not having motivation is one thing, but this?
4244:KyuteÅgI wish she'd show some motivation for once...Åh
4245:ShinkÅgThat does seem to be the problem.Åh
4246:How can I motivate Bibi...? I can't think of anything.
4247:Maybe I should talk with her head maid for some ideas?
4248:ShinkÅgAnd last is Comet... This has to be on purpose.Åh
4249:KyuteÅgAhaha, so you figured it out.Åh
4250:ShinkÅgYeah, it's utterly impossible to get the average score in every subject by chance.Åh
4251:Comet's grades are literally nothing but average.
4252:Not a point higher or lower. Exactly the average on every exam.
4253:She has to be taking measures to ensure this happens.
4254:ShinkÅgSo I have a second student who's very talented.Åh
4255:KyuteÅgNot quite as good as Vera, but she would be a top student if she tried seriously.Åh
4256:ShinkÅgWhat reason could she possibly have for doing this?Åh
4257:KyuteÅgIt looks like she calculates the average from the test questions and then answers accordingly...Åh
4258:ShinkÅgWhat's with that...Åh
4259:It's definitely an original way of taking a test. Does she think of it as a game or something?
4260:Increasing motivation is good and all, but that's probably the completely wrong approach for Comet.
4261:ShinkÅgI suppose I have to do something about her as well.Åh
4262:KyuteÅgPlease do. If you talk to them, they'll listen to your advice, won't they?Åh
4263:ShinkÅgMaybe...Åh
4264:I don't think it's likely, but it doesn't hurt to try.
4265:Figuring out how to motivate troublesome students is a teacher's lot, after all.
4266:ShinkÅgSigh, well first things first, I'll give it a shot.Åh
4267:KyuteÅgHehe, I'm hoping for your success.Åh
4268:ShinkÅgMe too. Thanks for your time, Kyute.Åh
4269:I thank Kyute for the encouragement and take my leave to head to my afternoon class.
4270:BibiÅgOh, professor. Good timing.Åh
4271:ShinkÅgHuh? What are you doing here? Isn't your next class about to start?Åh
4272:BibiÅgUh huh. I'm tired and not feeling up to it so I'm not going. Anyway, come with me for a sec.Åh
4273:ShinkÅgThat's rather bold to declare you're skipping to a teacher. Go to class.Åh
4274:BibiÅgNot happening.Åh
4275:ShinkÅgAt least think about it before answering! H-hey? What in the world...Åh
4276:Having given up on going to class, Bibi approaches me with an invigorated confidence.
4277:It seems like she wants me for something. Maybe if I listen I can get her to class in exchange.
4278:BibiÅgHere, look at this.Åh
4279:ShinkÅgHmm? Whoa, this window is smashed!Åh
4280:BibiÅgYep. From far away I thought it looked open, but turns out it wasn't.Åh
4281:ShinkÅgYou did this?Åh
4282:BibiÅgDamn straight.Åh
4283:ShinkÅgThis isn't something to be proud of! What do we do about this...Åh
4284:Considering how badly it's broken, it'll have to be replaced.
4285:Anyway, we better do something about the glass shards in the meantime.
4286:BibiÅgThanks professor. See ya.Åh
4287:ShinkÅgHold it!Åh
4288:BibiÅgGuh, what'd you do that for! That hurts.Åh
4289:ShinkÅgYou're not running away from this. You don't have to replace the window, but at least help clean up.Åh
4290:BibiÅgHuh...? Me? Clean up? Haha, that's a pretty good joke.Åh
4291:ShinkÅgLook here, I wouldn't joke about something like this.Åh
4292:From her tone of voice, she really did think I was joking, but I can't let her walk away.
4293:If should be obvious that if you do something wrong, you should take responsibility.
4294:BibiÅgYou weren't...? So you were seriously telling me I have to clean up?Åh
4295:ShinkÅgDead serious. That's only natural, isn't it?Åh
4296:BibiÅgHmm... It's natural to make me do menial tasks even though I'm going to be my hive's next queen?Åh
4297:ShinkÅgWhat does that matter? Whether you're a king or a queen, you have to be responsible for your actions.Åh
4298:BibiÅgThat may be how it works among humans, but I'm not obligated to follow your rules.Åh
4299:ShinkÅgHey now...Åh
4300:I slump my shoulders in disappointment at her response. It's sad to hear her say that.
4301:It may be true that this is simply a human custom, but how can I make a monster like Bibi understand anyway?
4302:ShinkÅg...Bibi?Åh
4303:BibiÅgHmm?Åh
4304:ShinkÅgI understand that you're a future queen. I also appreciate that this is a human practice.Åh
4305:BibiÅgReally? I'll be going then. Thanks for doing the dirty work, professor.Åh
4306:ShinkÅgHold on, I'm not done.Åh
4307:BibiÅgTch, what else... I thought we were in agreement?Åh
4308:Bibi gives me a hard, annoyed look and clicks her tongue.
4309:It looks like I'm irritating her, but I'm still not going to relent.
4310:She may hate it, but if I don't continue, Bibi isn't going to learn her lesson.
4311:ShinkÅgWith action comes responsibility. It doesn't matter whether you're man or monster, royalty or commoner.Åh
4312:ShinkÅgYou may have been fine before, but the world is changing. Humans and monsters are coming together, making compromises.Åh
4313:ShinkÅgWhat's going to happen if you keep living your life as you are now?Åh
4314:BibiÅg...well, what's going to happen?Åh
4315:She doesn't understand this either. She simply can't follow my logic.
4316:I bet she'd figure it out if she had been listening in class at least...
4317:ShinkÅgIt's simple. Evolve or die. That's it.Åh
FIXME maybe wrong?
4318:BibiÅgWhat basis do you have for that...Åh
4319:ShinkÅgHistory. Some human countries got sick of war and swore neutrality. They were attacked by humans and monsters both and destroyed.Åh
4320:ShinkÅgThey went against the times, and that was the result. They didn't consider where their responsibility lied.Åh
4321:Today's peaceful times may be different than the age of war, but the lessons learned from then still apply.
4322:Anyone who doesn't adapt is bound to have a hard time.
4323:BibiÅgSo therefore I have to do chores even as a future queen?Åh
4324:ShinkÅgBECAUSE you're a future queen. Whether you like it or not, the people at the top are held responsible.Åh
"are looked to for responsibility" or something, needs to be phrased better
4325:ShinkÅgIf you shirk menial tasks, things you don't know, and things that aren't required, you'll eventually regret it.Åh
Bleh.
4326:BibiÅgThat's quite an overreaction for simply cleaning up a broken window.Åh
4327:ShinkÅgSmall things like these reveal a person's true nature. You'd better keep that in mind.Åh
4328:BibiÅg......Åh
4329:Bibi closes her eyes as if she's considering what I've been telling her.
4330:What the... I get the feeling she's happily smiling...
4331:BibiÅgHuhu, I see. "Charmer" really does fit perfectly. Kuku, kukuku!Åh
Reference to Vera's line
4332:ShinkÅg...what?Åh
4333:BibiÅgOh, nothing. That was just the first time in my life I've been preached to. I see, I see. This is a new feeling.Åh
4334:ShinkÅgNo way...Åh
4335:What kind of life has she lived if no one has ever told her off? The life of a potential queen I guess...
4336:That makes sense at least.
4337:BibiÅgVery well. I'll lend my help so you can save face.Åh
4338:ShinkÅgDo it because it's the right thing to do.Åh
4339:BibiÅgHm, all right. I'll keep that in mind. Now then, let's get this over with quickly.Åh
4340:ShinkÅgSure.Åh
4341:It sounds like at least some of what I was trying to say got through to her.
4342:I was prepared to weather some complaints, but Bibi ended up being more rational than I gave her credit for.
4343:Perhaps this is a show of the huge potential someone with such a high status naturally has.
4344:ShinkÅgBe careful not to cut yourself.Åh
4345:BibiÅgI know. I wouldn't make a mistake like that.Åh
4346:Bibi looks as cheerful as always as the two of us begin cleaning up the glass.
4347:I'm glad that she listened to me, but for some reason I can't shake the feeling that things are only going to get more complicated.
FIXME length?
4348:ShinkÅgNow as you all know, exams are only a few days away.Åh
4349:I've covered all the required material so we'll spend the remaining classes reviewing.
4350:Unfortunately, some students don't seem to be here.
4351:ShinkÅgIs Rin taking a sick day?Åh
4352:CometÅgYes. Since lessons have ended, she's taking extra precautions to rest up.Åh
4353:ShinkÅgHmm, all right. If she pushes herself and misses exams, all her work will be for nothing.Åh
4354:Student 1ÅgProfessor! What are we doing today?Åh
4355:ShinkÅgI'm thinking that I'll have you study your worst subjects on your own. If there's anything you don't understand, ask me.Åh
4356:Student 2ÅgSelf study? OK, sleep time.Åh
4357:ShinkÅgHey hey, that's not cool...Åh
4358:The moment they heard me tell them to study alone, some students started dozing off.
4359:As far as I can see, the majority of them look listless. Are they not motivated to pass their exams?
4360:I've been trying to think of ways to motivate them over the last few days, but haven't come up with anything.
4361:Well, that's not entirely true, but...
4362:ShinkÅgWon't you girls show a bit more enthusiasm?Åh
4363:ShireneÅgI'm sufficiently motivated, aren't I?Åh
4364:ShinkÅgYeah, I know you are. Although...Åh
4365:ShireneÅgWhat? It sounds like you're worried. Are you implying something is wrong with me?Åh
4366:ShinkÅg......Åh
4367:How should I put this... I know she's enthusiastic, but she has a bigger problem than that...
4368:CometÅgYou're an idiot, Shirene.Åh
4369:ShireneÅgWh-what was that!?Åh
4370:VeraÅgAhaha! Nice one, nice one! You are an idiot!!Åh
4371:ShireneÅgH-how am I an idiot!?Åh
4372:CometÅgYour exam scores. You usually fail.Åh
4373:ShireneÅgUgh!Åh
4374:VeraÅgYou agree? When you hit a question you don't know, you stop there and leave the rest blank, don't you?Åh
4375:ShireneÅgUghaa!Åh
4376:CometÅgYou should skip ahead, but you're too stubborn, just like when fighting Vera. If that isn't stupid, what is?Åh
4377:ShireneÅgSh-shut up... I know. That's something... myself...Åh
4378:MiritaÅgUmmm... Comet, Vera, aren't you going...Åh
4379:VeraÅgHmm? This has to be said. Even if she knows, it's up to her whether she fixes the problem.Åh
Bleh.
4380:CometÅgIt's a little mean, but necessary. She IS an idiot, after all.Åh
4381:MiritaÅgEnough... Shirene, don't listen to them...Åh
4382:ShireneÅgNo, they're right. If I don't overcome my weaknesses, then I really am an idiot.Åh
4383:ShinkÅgCome on, don't be so hard on yourself...Åh
4384:Well, Comet and Vera just said most of what I wanted to say...
4385:I probably don't need to worry about Shirene now.
4386:ShinkÅgAnyway, I'd like you to get motivated too, Comet.Åh
4387:CometÅgMe? How rude. I'm always giving my full effort.Åh
4388:ShinkÅgThen maybe I should say you're focusing your efforts on the wrong things.Åh
4389:CometÅgExams are a game, after all. I found my own way of having fun with them. I'm a genius.Åh
4390:ShinkÅgIn no way...Åh
4391:How can she say that? What she's doing certainly is amazing, but I can't praise her for it.
4392:BibiÅgHmm, if you want everyone to try their best that badly...Åh
4393:ShinkÅgYes... I do...Åh
4394:BibiÅgHeh, then there's a simple way to do that, isn't there?Åh
4395:ShinkÅgA simple way?Åh
4396:Why do I have a really bad feeling about this...
4397:BibiÅgYou shouldn't be surprised. In fact, I bet you thought of this already.Åh
4398:ShinkÅgUgh...Åh
4399:Don't tell me...
4400:BibiÅgThat's right, a reward. That should be enough to motivate all the slackers in the class.Åh
4401:MiritaÅgHold on Bibi... That's a...Åh
4402:CometÅgHoo hoo, a reward. Kekekek... interesting. Very interesting.Åh
4403:ShinkÅgGah...Åh
4404:The atmosphere all throughout the classroom got tense the moment Bibi put forth her proposal.
4405:Some students are grinning ferociously, others are licking their lips. They're all focused on one thing though: me.
4406:ShinkÅgW-well, I did actually think of that, but... Th-there's no way I can reward everyone...Åh
lulz
4407:BibiÅgNo one's saying you have to reward the whole class. Let's see...Åh
4408:BibiÅgHow about this: reward whomever raises her score from the last exam the most. There shouldn't be any problem with that.Åh
4409:VeraÅgWait a minute! I can't win like that!!Åh
4410:MiritaÅgThat's right. Vera can't raise her score from the last exam at all. It's impossible.Åh
4411:CometÅgKuh, the average on the last exam was high. There isn't much room for improvement.Åh
4412:BibiÅgThis is for those students who usually don't try, not ones who already get high marks.Åh
4413:ShireneÅgWhen you put it that way... Yeah, it makes sense.Åh
4414:ShinkÅg......Åh
4415:Wow, this is going exactly as Bibi wants. She's pretty much tricking them all.
4416:Perhaps as expected from a future queen, she's showing her ability to force everyone to agree with her.
4417:Student 1ÅgThat's fine with me. Huhu, I'm looking forward to the professor's reward.Åh
4418:Student 2ÅgThe winner gets to choose the reward, right?Åh
4419:ShinkÅgUh, well, maybe that's...Åh
4420:BibiÅgNo problem. Well, on the condition that it's something our human professor is capable of.Åh
4421:ShinkÅgHey, that's not your decision...!!Åh
4422:VeraÅgAaah, whatever you want. I'm not part of this anyway.Åh
4423:MiritaÅgDoesn't seem that I'm likely to be in the running either. Good luck everyone.Åh
4424:ShinkÅgNo pity for me!?Åh
4425:This is bad. At this rate, I don't know what they'll demand from me!
Yes you do, Shink. Yes you do.
4426:I've got to do something to change that rule!
4427:CometÅgProfessor, please don't interrupt.Åh
4428:ShinkÅg...sigh.Åh
4429:Too late. Her serious stare lets me know that my opportunity to object has passed.
4430:BibiÅgIt's settled then. Heheh... I'm feeling quite motivated now for some reason.Åh
4431:ShinkÅgAh, is that so?Åh
4432:Sigh... Oh well, do whatever you like...
Or maybe something like "whatever happens, happens" but I like it being directed to Bibi since Shink seems to realize how rigged this game is.
4433:ShinkÅgWhy are you all here in my room?Åh
4434:After dinner, I was preparing for class tomorrow when all my problem students entered my room together.
4435:The atmosphere is strange, like all of them are keeping a close eye on the others.
4436:RinÅgUmm... Is what you said today in class true, Professor Shink?Åh
4437:ShinkÅgAaah, that? Honestly, it's true, but...Åh
4438:RinÅgI knew it! You're so mean! How could you make that promise when I wasn't even there...Åh
4439:BibiÅgWell, that was all part of my plan.Åh
Literally "I was aiming for that"
4440:CometÅgRin would never have allowed it if she were there. You knew that and played dirty.Åh
4441:BibiÅgHeh, say whatever you want. It's too late for him to back out.Åh
4442:ShinkÅgProbably, yeah...Åh
4443:Everyone in class is already worked up about the reward.
4444:If I canceled it now, it's not hard to imagine the riot that would occur.
4445:VeraÅgSigh, I'm bummed out. My always perfect scores keep me from winning.Åh
4446:CometÅgI'm in the same boat. It makes me wish I had failed the last exam...Åh
4447:ShinkÅgHey now, don't talk like that.Åh
4448:ShireneÅgYeah really. You could get everything right without studying, yet you aim for average on purpose. Gimme a break.Åh
4449:MiritaÅgAh, ahaha... I kind of agree with that...Åh
Or is she agreeing with Vera/Comet about wanting to have flunked the last exam? Ambiguous
4450:VeraÅgYeah, yeah. Oh well, I guess we can just cheer on those who are in the running?Åh
4451:RinÅgSigh... I don't think I'm likely to win. I wish the rules were a bit different...Åh
4452:BibiÅgBetter luck next time then.Åh
4453:ShinkÅgHaha... So is that all you came here to ask?Åh
4454:MiritaÅgAh, no... Actually, if it's all right with you, we wanted you to help us study.Åh
4455:ShinkÅgOh, I see.Åh
4456:In other words, they wanted to have a study group.
4457:I guess I should be glad that they're showing some motivation in coming here.
4458:BibiÅgIt'd make things a lot easier if you'd tell us what the exam questions are going to be.Åh
4459:ShinkÅgAs if.Åh
4460:BibiÅgHeh, doesn't hurt to ask. I didn't think you would.Åh
4461:ShireneÅgWe're wasting time. Let's hurry up and get started.Åh
4462:RinÅgThat's right. We don't want to keep Professor Shink up too late.Åh
4463:ShinkÅgOkay, I'm open to anything. Anything you don't understand, ask away.Åh
4464:The girls get to studying, and I go do my own thing in the meantime, keeping my eyes on them.
4465:ShinkÅgHow are you girls doing over there? Making good progress?Åh
4466:RinÅgAaah... Progress... Well...Åh
4467:VeraÅgI could never have dreamed there was a bigger idiot than Shirene in the world.Åh
4468:BibiÅgCome on, the world's a big place.Åh
4469:CometÅgWas that a joke? I'm not laughing.Åh
4470:ShinkÅgI see...Åh
4471:In other words, Bibi is doing worse than expected.
4472:Well, I guess this wasn't unpredictable.
4473:ShireneÅgI hope you'll stop calling me an idiot now...Åh
4474:MiritaÅgYeah, Shirene definitely understands everything well.Åh
4475:RinÅgBibi, this is all because you never pay attention in class.Åh
4476:BibiÅgHahaha, I never imagined I was this bad. I've surprised even myself.Åh
4477:VeraÅgAre you going to be all right as queen? Won't that be a disaster?Åh
4478:BibiÅgHmm, possibly. Well, my subordinates will be excellent so I don't think it'll be all that bad...Åh
4479:BibiÅgNevertheless, I have to do something. This is making me feel very uneasy.Åh
4480:ShinkÅgOh? Why the change of heart?Åh
4481:BibiÅgWhy, it's exactly as you told me, professor. Those on top have to take responsibility for what happens.Åh
4482:BibiÅgFrom now on, no more sleeping in class. I need to think for myself.Åh
Ç†ÇΩÇµÇ»ÇËÇ…évÇ§Ç±Ç∆Ç™Ç†ÇÈÇÒÇæÇÊ? I sometimes think in my own way.
4483:ShinkÅgGood to hear.Åh
4484:It makes me happy that she took my words to heart.
4485:If she continues down this path, she should make a great queen. The problem is now though.
4486:RinÅgThis isn't reassuring me much, but anyway, what are you going to do about this exam?Åh
She says a word made her concerned, but I have no idea what word she's talking about.
4487:MiritaÅgYeah. You might not get a zero, but you're certain to fail, Bibi.Åh
4488:CometÅgIs this the feeling that my chances have improved?Åh
Bleh
4489:ShireneÅgWe need to think of a quick fix...Åh
4490:VeraÅgBut how? You might scrape by if you cram all night, but I don't want to stick around that long.Åh
4491:ShinkÅgHmmm... Well, I wouldn't mind, but...Åh
4492:Would this be considered showing favoritism?
4493:It might not be right to lend a hand after the promise I made...
4494:KyuteÅgI hear you're in trouble! Leave it up to me!Åh
4495:ShinkÅg...Kyute? When did you get here?Åh
4496:KyuteÅgJust now. I heard you from outside.Åh
4497:ShinkÅgOh, okay... In the future, please use the door.Åh
4498:Why did she come in through the window? My room is rather high up, but I guess it isn't too strange for her to fly in.
4499:KyuteÅgAhem. Anyway, it seems that Bibi is finally showing some motivation. Now leave the rest to me!Åh
4500:ShinkÅgHmm... Bibi?Åh
4501:BibiÅgI don't have any complaints... but is this really going to help?Åh
4502:KyuteÅgWh-what do you mean by that? Don't you trust me?Åh
4503:BibiÅgIt's not that, it's just from seeing your usual class...Åh
4504:KyuteÅgGah! It's true I do make a little mistake now and then, but it'll be all right!Åh
4505:VeraÅgYeah! This will work. I know we can trust Kyute with this. Right, Mirita?Åh
Kyute-nee again
4506:MiritaÅgUh, yeah... it'll work, but are you planning on doing... that?Åh
4507:ShinkÅg......?Åh
4508:What's "that?"
4509:From looking at Mirita's expression, I get the feeling she's scared of something.
4510:KyuteÅgOf course! The method that even Vera ran away from: the study plan from hell!!Åh
4511:ShinkÅgUgh...!?Åh
4512:RinÅgVera ran away!?Åh
4513:CometÅgNow I'm scared.Åh
4514:MiritaÅgYeah, it's frightening... I'm shivering just remembering it.Åh
4515:VeraÅgI didn't run away. I prefer to think of it as a tactical withdrawal!Åh
4516:ShinkÅgWow, she did run away...Åh
4517:What kind of study session could break such a stellar student?
4518:KyuteÅgHow about it? If you accept, I won't hold back.Åh
4519:BibiÅgSounds fine. Something that made even Vera run must be interesting.Åh
4520:ShireneÅgMay I join in too?Åh
4521:MiritaÅgEh!? Shirene, you'd better not...Åh
4522:ShireneÅgIt's an opportunity to accomplish something Vera couldn't. Haha, I'm so excited!Åh
4523:ShinkÅgOh man...Åh
4524:Shirene, you don't have to compete with Vera in everything, especially this.
4525:KyuteÅgHeheh, I heard the resolve in your voices. Don't try to escape halfway now.Åh
4526:BibiÅgI, I'll rise to the challenge.Åh
4527:ShireneÅgEscape is not in my dictionary!Åh
Same phrase Vera used earlier
4528:VeraÅgAaah, no matter what happens, don't die on us.Åh
4529:MiritaÅgW-well... They're on their own.Åh
Have to be responsible for themselves
4530:RinÅgYou aren't going to participate, Comet?Åh
4531:CometÅgYou're kidding. I don't want to die young.Åh
4532:Having finished speaking, everyone turns to face Kyute for one last time before they leave.
4533:I have no idea what's going to happen. I can only pray for their safety.
4534:ShireneÅgD-death... That was death...Åh
4535:ShinkÅgWhoa! What happened? You look like you have three hooves in the grave...Åh
4536:VeraÅgShe literally is near death. That's what happens when you participate in Kyute's study plan from hell.Åh
4537:MiritaÅgOooh... Don't remind me.Åh
4538:ShinkÅg......Åh
4539:What kind of studying could possibly do that...
4540:RinÅgAhaha... Perhaps not going was the right choice after all.Åh
4541:CometÅgI was right to trust my instincts. That was a close call.Åh
4542:ShinkÅgThat's a rather harsh way of putting it...Åh
4543:ShireneÅgNo, they have the right of it. I honestly underestimated her...Åh
4544:VeraÅgThere are still a few days before exams though. You'd better prepare yourself. It gets worse.Åh
4545:ShireneÅgIt can get worse...?Åh
4546:Shirene slumps down in front of the table in reaction.
4547:Seriously, what happened to make Shirene this tired?
4548:ShinkÅgHuh? Where's Bibi? Weren't you studying together?Åh
4549:ShireneÅgAah, since Bibi couldn't even handle the basics, she had to do more than me.Åh
4550:ShireneÅgShe's most likely still asleep. Just looking at what she was doing was dreadful...Åh
4551:ShinkÅgReally now, what did she have you two doing...?Åh
4552:MiritaÅgProfessor, don't worry about it. Honestly, just don't ask.Åh
4553:ShinkÅgH-hey now..Åh
4554:I'd better not pry any further at the risk of digging up Mirita's traumatic experience.
4555:Out of the corner of my eye, I notice Vera simply shaking her head.
4556:KyuteÅgIt sounds like I've developed quite the reputation...Åh
4557:ShinkÅgWhoa!? K-Kyute, don't startle me like that!Åh
4558:KyuteÅgI didn't do anything. Anyway, Shirene, why are you averting your eyes?Åh
4559:ShireneÅgI, I'm not... No reason. It, it's the truth.Åh
4560:VeraÅgAaaah, Kyute... You went overboard, didn't you?Åh
4561:KyuteÅgIt shouldn't have been that bad. Hmmm, was it really so hard on you?Åh
4562:ShireneÅgNo, no way... I wouldn't complain about something so trivial!Åh
4563:KyuteÅgI see. Good to hear. I'm going to be even more strict today then!Åh
4564:ShireneÅgEhh, wai...!?Åh
4565:VeraÅgBluffing at bad times... You'll get no sympathy from me, you know?Åh
Bleh. Reference to the way Shirene acted tough in front of Vera I assume. "Imprudently acting tough... I really don't care, you see?
4566:MiritaÅgI'm sorry, Shirene... I can't do anything for you either...Åh
4567:RinÅgYou have my sympathies, but I don't want to help and accidentally get dragged in with you...Åh
4568:CometÅgShirene sacrificed herself so that the rest of us may enjoy peace.Åh
4569:ShireneÅgY-you're all so insensitive!!Åh
4570:ShinkÅg......Åh
4571:She'll reap what she sowed today. She should have honestly told Kyute it was tough.
4572:When it comes to this, there's nothing for me to do either.
4573:ShinkÅgAll right, it's getting to be that time. You should all prepare for class.Åh
4574:RinÅgWhat are you going to do, Professor Shink?Åh
4575:ShinkÅgHmm, I think I'll go check on Bibi first.Åh
4576:KyuteÅgOh, speaking of her, please tell Bibi she'll be doing double if she's late.Åh
4577:ShinkÅg...will do.Åh
4578:That will serve as good motivation if Bibi doesn't want to get up on her own.
4579:With that on my mind, I head over to Bibi's room.
4580:BibiÅgZzz... Mmmn... Stop, no more...Åh
4581:ShinkÅg......Åh
4582:I peek my head into Bibi's room to check on her. It looks like she's having a hell of a nightmare.
4583:What did Kyute do to her...!?
This is getting redundant
4584:ShinkÅgDamn, it's going to be even harder than normal to get her up. Hey, Bibi! Rise and shine!!Åh
4585:BibiÅgUuugh, impossible. I can't get up, no way. So sleepy...Åh
4586:ShinkÅgNot this again...Åh
4587:Was she up all night or something? No, I can't imagine Kyute would go that far.
4588:She's probably just so worn out that she can't get up...
4589:Well, once she gets out of bed, the drowsiness should wear off too.
4590:BibiÅgZzz... Mmn... I'm taking today off... No more.Åh
4591:ShinkÅgAll right, no problem. Kyute asked me to deliver a message though.Åh
4592:I can't let her skip classes today so I'll go straight to my trump card.
4593:I don't know how effective it'll be, but given the nightmare she was having, I'm expecting good results.
4594:ShinkÅgShe told me that you'll be doing twice as much if you're late today.Åh
4595:BibiÅgLet's go, professor! I'll be ready for class in a second!Åh
4596:ShinkÅgWhoa!?Åh
4597:Before I even finish my sentence, Bibi enthusiastically jumps out of bed.
4598:Even given the circumstances, that was impossibly effective.
4599:ShinkÅgHey, why are you naked all of a sudden!Åh
4600:BibiÅgWhat? I have to change into my clothes, obviously.Åh
4601:ShinkÅgWith me still in the room!?Åh
4602:BibiÅg...? Aah, I shouldn't expose myself to a man?Åh
4603:ShinkÅgYeah, exactly.Åh
4604:BibiÅgYou can wait outside if you want then. I don't care either way.Åh
4605:ShinkÅgYou should care!Åh
4606:BibiÅgNope. This isn't the time to worry about that. Twice as much work... she has to be joking.Åh
4607:I stare in dumbfounded amazement as Bibi quickly changes out of her pajamas.
4608:Wait, I shouldn't be ogling her like this!
4609:ShinkÅgA-anyway, see you in class. Don't be late!Åh
4610:BibiÅgYou don't need to tell me twice. I'm not such a masochist to willingly increase my workload.Åh
4611:ShinkÅgTh-that's good... Okay, I'm out...!Åh
4612:Reassured by Bibi, I turn to leave her room.
4613:However, Bibi grabs my hand and stops me.
4614:ShinkÅgWh-what are you...!Åh
4615:BibiÅgYou can turn around now. I'm done getting dressed.Åh
4616:ShinkÅgOkay, but why did you...Åh
4617:BibiÅgPlease do my hair. I can't do it myself.Åh
4618:ShinkÅgHuh? Where are your maids?Åh
4619:BibiÅgI dismissed them last night. I figured I'd take care of myself, but didn't realize how convenient they were.Åh
4620:ShinkÅg......Åh
4621:I see. That's a good attitude to have, but maybe she should have taken things more slowly.
4622:ShinkÅgJust this once, okay? Ask your maids to teach you how to do it yourself later.Åh
4623:BibiÅgI know, I will. Thanks though. You should really think of it as an honor to touch my hair.Åh
4624:ShinkÅgUh huh.Åh
4625:Bibi puffs her chest out in pride and gives me a wry smile as I step behind to do her hair.
4626:I never thought I'd be doing something like this as a teacher.
4627:But I guess there's no time so someone has to do it.
4628:ShinkÅgI'm not quite sure how to do this either. Does this look right?Åh
4629:BibiÅgI don't care as long as it looks decent. Just hurry up, I don't have much time.Åh
4630:ShinkÅgGotcha.Åh
4631:Bibi squirms in impatience as I fix her hair, barely holding back a smile.
4632:ShinkÅgWhew. I'm pooped.Åh
4633:After morning classes are over, I head up to the roof to stretch my legs and take a breather.
4634:I've already decided on the exam questions and created it too.
4635:All I have to do is proctor it. I'd like to believe none of my students would try to cheat, but...
4636:ShinkÅgEven if they do, I probably won't be able to catch them.Åh
4637:PhamÅgOh, then shall I accompany you?Åh
4638:ShinkÅg...ah, you again.Åh
4639:PhamÅgHehe, appearing unexpectedly is my specialty. I'm second to none.Åh
4640:ShinkÅgIndeed you are.Åh
4641:It seems I've gotten used to Pham randomly showing up.
4642:ShinkÅgSo anyway, what do you mean by accompanying me?Åh
4643:PhamÅgExactly what it sounds like. You can't prevent your students from cheating with their monster abilities by yourself, right?Åh
4644:PhamÅgIf I'm there, I can see everything. No one can see me, after all.Åh
4645:ShinkÅgI see. That sounds promising.Åh
4646:Someone who can't be seen would definitely make the best proctor.
4647:If I can get her to help, I should take advantage of it.
4648:ShinkÅgIs this all right though? For some reason I get the feeling that you're only interested in me.Åh
I don't get the nuance of this sentence. I think it's something like Pham hasn't had any effect on anyone but Shink, and now she'll be meddling with the other students.
4649:PhamÅgI'm interested in you because you're the only one who can see me.Åh
Essentially she's only meddling with him because he's the only one that can see her. Both these lines may need work. FIXME
4650:ShinkÅgI don't understand why that's the case in the first place...Åh
4651:Why can't anyone else see her? It's not like I have some special connection to her...
4652:PhamÅgWhy, I wonder? Perhaps the time will come when you finally understand?Åh
4653:ShinkÅgSigh...Åh
4654:She avoided the question again. Maybe she doesn't want to tell me...
4655:ShinkÅgFine. I suppose it doesn't matter who or what you are.Åh
4656:PhamÅgOh my, you aren't going to press me harder?Åh
4657:ShinkÅgTell me whenever you want to. No matter what happens, you never change.Åh
"No matter what, Pham is Pham."
4658:PhamÅg......Åh
4659:ShinkÅgHmm? Is something wrong?Åh
4660:PhamÅgNo, it's nothing. Hehe, I simply felt a shock for a second there.Åh
Maybe something like "my heart skipped a beat" but she's a ghost so...
4661:ShinkÅg...? All right then...Åh
4662:What caused her a shock? I didn't mean to say anything special.
4663:Did I say something that would lead me to her true identity?
4664:PhamÅgHehe, don't worry about it. Keep doing what you're doing.Åh
4665:ShinkÅgSure. I'll live with not understanding.Åh
4666:PhamÅgGood, that's for the best. Anyway, what about my offer?Åh
4667:ShinkÅgHmmm... Thanks, but I'll pass. I'll make do.Åh
4668:PhamÅgReally? You'll let them cheat under your nose?Åh
4669:ShinkÅgThat's not going to happen. I hope not, at least.Åh
4670:Yeah. There may be a few cheaters, but I don't think I'll go with her plan.
4671:At the very least, I think we have a relationship of mutual trust. If not, I was simply naive.
4672:PhamÅgHmm... Hehe, I see. Sorry for the needless meddling.Åh
4673:ShinkÅgNo, thanks for offering to help.Åh
4674:PhamÅgDon't mention it. Anyway, time for me to vanish. Good luck.Åh
4675:ShinkÅgOkay.Åh
4676:I say goodbye to the smiling Pham as she disappears, psyching myself up in the process.
4677:She's supported me since I first arrived. Just receiving encouragement from her makes me feel better.
4678:Now that I think about it, I've been able to persevere like this because of Pham's concern for me.
Kind of awkward
4679:I really have a lot to thank her for.
4680:ShinkÅgAll right, I better work hard this afternoon.Åh
4681:I take one last stretch and head down from the roof.
4682:TeacherÅgExams begin today! Are you ready for them, girls?!Åh
4683:StudentsÅgYeah!!Åh
4684:TeacherÅgDid you study hard?!Åh
4685:StudentsÅgYeah!!Åh
4686:TeacherÅgYou're going to cheat without getting caught?!Åh
4687:StudentsÅgYeah!!Åh
4688:TeacherÅgIDIOTS! NO CHEATING!!Åh
4689:StudentsÅgWe won't!!Åh
4690:TeacherÅgOK, OK! As long as you're sorry!Åh
This whole sequence probably should be more theatrical.
4691:Several days later, the big day is finally here.
4692:I'm glad it is, but...
4693:ShinkÅg...what's with all this?Åh
4694:KyuteÅgAh, ahaha... Well, exams are a big event around here...Åh
4695:ShinkÅgIt's always like this?Åh
4696:KyuteÅgYeah, well...Åh
4697:ShinkÅgCrazy.Åh
4698:Honestly, if exams whip up this kind of furor every time, I won't be able to attend.
4699:I wonder how well my students are going to do...
4700:ShireneÅgIt's all right. I can do this. Just remembering those study sessions...Åh
4701:RinÅgI'm perfectly healthy... *cough* I'll be fine, just fine.Åh
4702:CometÅgYou don't sound fine. Are you going to be able to pass your physical education exam?Åh
4703:RinÅgP-probably...Åh
4704:MiritaÅgSigh... Time after time, such an insane atmosphere...Åh
4705:VeraÅgI don't mind it at all!Åh
4706:BibiÅgSorry to everyone else, but I'm confident this time. Rather, there's no way I couldn't be after that... Ugh...Åh
4707:ShireneÅgI know. That was... demanding.Åh
4708:MiritaÅgYou endured all the way to the end. That's just...Åh
4709:Student 1ÅgTime to win Shink! Win! Win! Win!Åh
4710:Student 2ÅgFood! Food! Food!Åh
4711:ShinkÅg......Åh
4712:Oh well, I'm relieved to see everyone is their usual selves.
4713:A few of them are yelling some disconcerting things, but it'll be all right I guess.
4714:TeacherÅgOK everyone! To your testing locations, advance!!Åh
4715:StudentsÅgRoger!!Åh
4716:ShinkÅgHe kept up that performance the entire time...Åh
Bleh "This mood to the last minute..."
4717:Am I going to eventually be corrupted like him? I hate to think so...
Corrupted maybe not the best word
4718:KyuteÅgShall we get a move on too?Åh
4719:ShinkÅgYeah. Actually, I'm supposed to be here.Åh
4720:KyuteÅgOh, is that right? Well then, let's do our best today.Åh
4721:ShinkÅgYeah. See ya...Åh
4722:Kyute and I exchange farewells and part ways.
4723:Now then, first up is supervising the physical education exam. I'm looking forward to watching this.
4724:VeraÅgSoyaaaaa!!Åh
4725:ShinkÅgWhere'd she go!?Åh
4726:CometÅgHer ability to jump like a bug never ceases to amaze me.Åh
4727:MiritaÅgThe height of this measuring stick shows how incomprehensible Vera really is.Åh
FIXME maybe? Its height tells a story of Vera's ambiguity?
4728:RinÅgHarder, harder... Ah!Åh
4729:ShinkÅgGrip strength, over 500 kilograms.Åh
4730:RinÅgSigh, not very good.Åh
4731:ShinkÅgHow is that not very good?Åh
4732:CometÅgThat's extremely weak for Rin's race. They're normally much stronger.Åh
4733:ShinkÅgReally...Åh
4734:I almost want to hit myself for thinking this would be fun to watch...
4735:Every one of these girls is capable on a level unimaginable to humans.
4736:ShireneÅgForty seconds, not bad.Åh
4737:ShinkÅg...that was an entire kilometer.Åh
4738:MiritaÅgUmm, you shouldn't worry about it, you know?Åh
"If you worry, you lose" Strange phrase.
4739:ShinkÅgOh yeah. I'm well aware of that now.Åh
4740:It's hurting my head just trying to put all this into terms my human brain can comprehend.
"I seem to become mentally tired with that alone if I think with human common sense."
4741:Enough of that. I'm simply going to enter their scores from now on.
4742:ShinkÅgTime's up. Please pass your exams forward.Åh
4743:After seeing more incredible things in one day than most people see in their entire lives, exams are over for now.
4744:It's strangely quiet though. Judging from how the class normally acts, I expected a lot more noise.
4745:Student 1ÅgUeee... That was so hard.Åh
4746:Student 2ÅgI doubt I did well either. Damn, I spent all that time thinking of what to do with Professor Shink...Åh
4747:I see. That's why.
4748:It appears that the possibility of reward motivated them, but that isn't all that praise-worthy.
4749:RinÅgHow'd you fare, Comet?Åh
4750:CometÅgIt was tough to calculate the average. Too many irregularities this time.Åh
4751:RinÅgEh...? You didn't try your hardest?Åh
4752:CometÅgI tried my hardest to predict the average score. I gave up on the reward from the beginning.Åh
4753:RinÅgOh, is that right...Åh
4754:CometÅgThe scores should be higher than usual anyway. I'm satisfied. How about you?Åh
4755:RinÅgYes. I felt I did much better than usual myself.Åh
4756:VeraÅgAnd I...Åh
4757:MiritaÅgYou don't have to tell us, Vera. A perfect score, right?Åh
4758:VeraÅgSo mean! But yeah, exactly.Åh
4759:ShireneÅgYou never change. I have no idea how you're always so confident.Åh
4760:VeraÅgFuhahaha! That's just the way I am, I guess!Åh
4761:ShireneÅgIf you behaved yourself, everyone could have perfect scores.Åh
4762:ShinkÅgAll right, you can talk, but keep it down please.Åh
4763:The class bursts into activity as all the students let out their post-exam stress.
4764:I know how they feel, but they could at least wait until I've left.
4765:BibiÅgHaa... It's really over? I'm so sleepy...Åh
4766:RinÅgAh, Bibi. How'd it go?Åh
4767:BibiÅgWho knows... I did what I could. Beyond that, no clue.Åh
4768:MiritaÅgNot optimistic?Åh
4769:BibiÅgGiven all the knowledge I had beaten into me, I'm much more optimistic than normal, but I don't know how well I did.Åh
4770:BibiÅgAt any rate, it feels nice to give something my full effort every now and then. That's good enough for me.Åh
4771:ShinkÅgWow, that's rather admirable.Åh
4772:BibiÅgHeh. This doesn't mean I've given up on that reward. If I win, you'd better be ready.Åh
4773:ShinkÅgBe ready, huh...Åh
4774:What in the world is she going to do to me?
Come on Shink.
4775:RinÅgUngh... I've got a bad feeling about this.Åh
4776:CometÅgSame here. Surely she wouldn't... No, there's no reason...Åh
4777:ShireneÅgYou girls really never stop thinking about that, do you?Åh
4778:RinÅgYou aren't worried, Shirene?Åh
4779:ShireneÅgLook here, don't lump me in with the rest of you.Åh
4780:MiritaÅgAh, ahaha...Åh
4781:ShinkÅg...???Åh
4782:Huh? They're muttering something between themselves just outside of my hearing...
4783:Whatever, it probably has nothing to do with me. I need to hurry up and leave.
4784:ShinkÅgAll right, break it up. Don't get too excited just because it's over.Åh
4785:VeraÅgYeah really.Åh
4786:ShinkÅgYou're the one I'm worried about the most.Åh
4787:VeraÅgAhaha! Shink is so funny!Åh
4788:ShinkÅgYeah, yeah. Mirita, if Vera gets out of control, stop her.Åh
4789:MiritaÅgUeee!? Me!?Åh
4790:ShinkÅgYeah, you're old friends, aren't you?Åh
4791:MiritaÅgAuu, yeah... Okay, I still think it'll be impossible though...Åh
4792:Mirita slumps her shoulders, looking for compassion, but I have no one else to turn to.
4793:I seriously doubt any of the other students can control Vera.
4794:BibiÅgSigh... I can finally sleep.Åh
4795:ShireneÅgMe too. I'm going to sleep the rest of the day. I'm so tired...Åh
4796:ShinkÅgGood job you two, get some rest.Åh
4797:I call out to the two exhausted students as I exit the noisy classroom.
4798:Apparently I have to grade all the exams before class tomorrow. That's just crazy.
4799:Well, I guess it isn't unreasonable for all the other teachers since they're monsters...
4800:At any rate, today and tomorrow are going to be awful.
4801:ShinkÅgStill so much to do...Åh
4802:I've been grading nonstop ever since I got back to my room, but there's still no end in sight.
4803:There's no way I could have finished them all in one sitting though. I'm not that fast.
4804:ShinkÅgI got a lot of them graded though.Åh
4805:Compared to the past results that I looked at, everyone has done better across the board.
4806:Did they want the reward that badly? Or was my teaching effective?
4807:The latter would make me extremely happy.
4808:KyuteÅgShink? Are you still awake?Åh
4809:ShinkÅgYeah, come on in.Åh
4810:KyuteÅgHuhu, sorry for coming at this hour.Åh
4811:As I reflect on what I've seen from the exams so far, I hear a knock at the door.
4812:Kyute comes in, her face beaming in delight.
4813:ShinkÅgYou look rather pleased.Åh
4814:KyuteÅgYes. Everyone's grades have improved on this exam.Åh
4815:ShinkÅgI see. On yours too?Åh
4816:KyuteÅgAh, your exam scores are up too? I'm so glad.Åh
4817:ShinkÅgYeah. It'd be great if this means some of what I tried to teach them got through.Åh
4818:KyuteÅgHuhu, you should have more confidence in yourself. Your lectures have a good reputation.Åh
4819:ShinkÅgAh, haha, that's reassuring.Åh
4820:I'm really glad. As a human here, being told that my teaching is good makes all the effort worthwhile.
4821:I sure have been through a lot...
4822:KyuteÅgAnyway, how goes the grading? It's not easy to get it all done in a day.Åh
4823:ShinkÅgI'm realizing that. The other teachers are amazing if they can do that.Åh
4824:KyuteÅgThey're just used to it by now. Would you like some help?Åh
4825:ShinkÅgI'd love your help, but I'd actually like to try doing this on my own.Åh
4826:Besides, I want to see the results of all my students' efforts for myself.
4827:KyuteÅgReally? I'd better get out of your way then.Åh
4828:ShinkÅgAhaha, sorry. Thanks for the offer.Åh
4829:KyuteÅgNo, no it's fine. I know how you feel. Just don't overdo it, okay?Åh
4830:ShinkÅgI won't. I'll keep taking it slow and steady.Åh
4831:KyuteÅgHuhu, keep up the good work then.Åh
4832:Kyute smiles as if satisfied with my reply and leaves the room.
4833:After the door closes, I turn my eyes back to the pile of exam sheets on my desk.
4834:ShinkÅgAll right. Round two, let's go!Åh
4835:I've got to make sure to calculate the winner of the reward while I'm at it...
4836:Who is going to win and what in the world is she going to want from me...
4837:ShinkÅgAll done...Åh
4838:How long has it been since I started working again... Looking at the time, it's already late into the night.
4839:It seems that I was able to do it after all. Tomorrow morning is going to be just as bad though...
4840:ShinkÅgIt's amazing that no one failed.Åh
4841:Well, it shouldn't be such a surprise. I didn't expect anyone to have a hard time passing.
4842:Still, if anyone didn't grasp the basics, she wouldn't have scored many points.
4843:So at least that means everyone understood that much.
4844:ShinkÅgVera's exam was flawless, no problem with Rin's or Mirita's either. Comet got precisely the average...Åh
4845:She sure does put effort into the strangest things.
4846:ShinkÅgShirene was close to the average, but that's great for her.Åh
4847:ShinkÅgAnd Bibi... It's hard to believe she got all zeroes up until now.Åh
4848:Her grade wasn't all that good, but considering she didn't even know the basics a few days ago, it's amazing progress.
4849:I don't know how well everyone did in their other subjects, but I can't imagine Bibi didn't show the most improvement overall.
4850:ShinkÅgOh well, now isn't the time to worry about that.Åh
4851:I'd better hurry up and get these submitted.
4852:After that, I'll check my students' other subjects and then the matter of fulfilling the reward.
4853:ShinkÅgThe hard part is going to be waking up in the morning...Åh
4854:Just thinking about that is depressing. I put it out of my mind and head out to finish up for the night.
4855:After all this is over, I'm going to flop down on my bed and instantly pass out.
4856:ShinkÅgOkay, time to hand back your exams.Åh
4857:Last night I submitted my exam scores and checked on the results for my homeroom students.
4858:Due to the exams starting in the afternoon, no one is asleep. Rather, they're all staring at me in expectation.
FIXME exams aren't over? Or exams started in the afternoon? Doesn't make logical sense.
4859:Do they want the reward that badly?
4860:RinÅgUmmm... Professor Shink, you look pale. Are you feeling well?Åh
4861:ShinkÅgYeah... I was up late grading and didn't sleep much.Åh
4862:MiritaÅgAre you all right? If you're tired, you shouldn't strain yourself.Åh
4863:ShinkÅgI'm fine, just sleepy. It's no big deal.Åh
4864:I'm telling them the truth. I'm simply sleepy.
4865:I'm not feverish, and I don't have any other symptoms either. I'm generally healthy.
4866:CometÅgHe doesn't seem to be lying so I believe him.Åh
4867:ShinkÅgThanks. Now then, the results of the exam.Åh
4868:Student 1Åg......Åh
4869:Student 2ÅgMy heart's pounding...Åh
4870:As soon as I say "results," the mood in the classroom abruptly changes.
4871:Everyone looks on completely on edge. Well, I guess that's only natural.
4872:VeraÅgSo who was it? Not that I ever had a chance.Åh
4873:ShinkÅgDon't get so fussy. You should be happy that you got perfect scores in every subject.Åh
4874:VeraÅgAs if that was ever in doubt.Åh
4875:ShireneÅgDamn, hearing you say that is so irritating.Åh
4876:MiritaÅgAh, ahaha... Try being a bit more humble...Åh
4877:BibiÅgForget about Vera, who won after all?Åh
4878:ShinkÅgSo... The student who made the most improvement was...Åh
4879:ClassÅg.........Åh
4880:The whole class gulps and holds their breath as I look down at the results in my hand.
4881:Every time I read them, I can't believe it. I guess I should stop being rude and announce the winner though.
4882:ShinkÅg...Bibi, congratulations.Åh
4883:BibiÅgWhat...?Åh
4884:ShinkÅgIt was you. You won.Åh
4885:BibiÅg......Åh
4886:VeraÅgOooh... The queen of zeroes herself? Amazing.Åh
4887:MiritaÅgR-really? Was Kyute's study plan from hell that effective?Åh
4888:ShireneÅgKuh, I went through the same thing. I suppose starting from zero made the difference.Åh
4889:RinÅgUghhh, I knew I couldn't win...Åh
4890:CometÅgDon't worry. Something will go your way eventually.Åh
4891:After the announcement, I pick up bits and pieces of everyone's reactions.
4892:Even Bibi can't believe she won. She's standing stock still with her eyes shut.
4893:ShinkÅgHey, Bibi? You all right? Are you listening?Åh
4894:BibiÅgAh, yeah... I'm listening. I was just a bit surprised...Åh
4895:BibiÅgIt was my proposal in the first place, but I never thought I'd be the winner. I owe Professor Kyute a lot of thanks.Åh
FIXME Really? I didn't get that impression. Need to revise earlier lines maybe.
4896:ShinkÅgThanking her is a good idea, but your grades came from your own effort. You should be more proud of yourself.Åh
4897:BibiÅgUh, heheh, that's true. This is the first time I've made such an effort. Haha, what a nice feeling.Åh
4898:Having achieved success for the first time through her own work, Bibi seems deeply moved and begins to laugh in good humor.
4899:Feeling a sense of accomplishment like that is excellent for her growth into an adult. I'm extremely happy for her.
4900:ShinkÅgSo anyway, what do you want as a reward...Åh
4901:BibiÅgAh, that's right. Hmm, I can't think of anything off the top of my head. Do you mind waiting awhile?Åh
4902:ShinkÅgNo problem. Nothing absurd, okay?Åh
4903:BibiÅgI know, don't worry.Åh
4904:Was that enough of a reminder?
4905:I'm very curious to hear what she asks for... and a bit apprehensive as well.
4906:ShinkÅgWell enough about that. Form a line up here at the front to get your exams back.Åh
4907:With the matter of the reward postponed, I begin hanging out the exam sheets.
4908:It's rather interesting to see the varying looks on their faces when they see their scores, some elated, some dejected.
4909:ShinkÅgHere you go, Bibi. Well done.Åh
4910:BibiÅgHaha, thank you. By the way, will you meet me on the roof after school?Åh
FIXME óÁÇåæÇ¡ÇƒÇ®Ç≠
4911:ShinkÅgHmm? What for?Åh
4912:BibiÅgI already came up with what I want for my reward.Åh
4913:BibiÅgIt'd probably be annoying if other people heard us. So I was thinking we should be alone.Åh
4914:ShinkÅgI see...Åh
4915:I suppose it could be awkward to tell me what she wants in front of the whole class.
4916:Although I didn't think Bibi was the type to care about something like that.
4917:ShinkÅgAll right. After school, on the roof.Åh
4918:BibiÅgYeah. Heheh, I'll be eagerly waiting.Åh
4919:With a thin smile on her face, Bibi steps out of the way for the next student.
4920:It's such a simple promise... So why is a chill running down my spine?
4921:ShinkÅgMust be my imagination. Next!Åh
4922:Brushing off the chill as nothing important, I continue handing out the exams.
4923:But for the rest of class, I can't help but wonder what she's going to demand from me...
4924:ShinkÅgSo what did you decide on?Åh
4925:I head up to the roof after school as promised. With some hesitation in my voice, I ask Bibi.
4926:I was mostly curious before, but now I'm more nervous than anything...
4927:BibiÅgIt isn't anything difficult. I just want you to be mine. Simple, right?Åh
4928:ShinkÅgCome again?Åh
4929:Be hers? What the hell does that mean?
4930:BibiÅgThe last few days convinced me. Having people who are completely servile isn't enough.Åh
4931:BibiÅgThey're useful too, but a queen needs people with their own opinions who will candidly give advice.Åh
4932:BibiÅgFrom seeing the current queen, I really didn't want to be her successor, but with someone like you by my side, it won't be so bad.Åh
4933:BibiÅgTherefore, I want you to be mine.Åh
4934:ShinkÅg......Åh
4935:In other words, I'd be Bibi's subordinate?
4936:My job would be an adviser to the queen...?
4937:ShinkÅgUmm, I don't think that's possible...Åh
4938:BibiÅgWhy not? If it's because you're human, that's nonsense. You're the one that said monsters and humans are working together more and more.Åh
4939:ShinkÅgThat's true, but I'm satisfied being a teacher. I'd like to keep doing it.Åh
4940:ShinkÅgSo I can't accept.Åh
4941:I still want to teach and do other things...
4942:BibiÅgHeheh, I see... Haha, you really did decline my invitation. You never cease to intrigue me, professor.Åh
4943:BibiÅgHowever, I won't give up so easily. I'll use other means to convince you, like this...Åh
4944:Bibi gives me a seductive look as she slowly sidles up to me.
4945:I've got a bad feeling... Perhaps I'd better back away...
4946:BibiÅgOops, no running. If you become mine, we can do this all the time. Here, let me teach you.Åh
Teach is usually an awkward translation here, but I like the teacher-student parallel
4947:ShinkÅgWhoa, hold on, this is way too sudden!Åh
4948:BibiÅgIt isn't particularly sudden. I thought you'd decline so I was determined to do this from the beginning.Åh
4949:ShinkÅgCome on, someone's going to hear us up there!Åh
4950:I couldn't anticipate this at all so I didn't even have any suspicions...
Seriously, Shink? Sentence sounds less awkward in Japanese
4951:I immediately tried to escape, but Bibi overpowered me and lowered my body to the ground.
4952:BibiÅgHehe, don't fight it. Come on, I'll make you feel really good.Åh
4953:ShinkÅg...whoa!Åh
4954:Unable to resist her, I'm at the mercy of those alluring eyes.
4955:ShinkÅgGah, stop it Bibi!Åh
4956:BibiÅgOh my, this is odd... Your cock is already rock hard.Åh
4957:BibiÅgDoesn't this mean you're more than willing?Åh
4958:ShinkÅgGuh, that's just...Åh
4959:From the moment Bibi approached and threw me down, my penis was already thinking on its own.
4960:I'm not sure why, but just having Bibi close to me wraps my body in a pleasing sense of euphoria.
4961:BibiÅgHehe, this is fine, right? Having fun and reaching orgasm is what men live for isn't it...Åh
4962:BibiÅgLook, just by grabbing your cock like this...Åh
4963:ShinkÅgKuh...!Åh
4964:Bibi gives me a little squeeze and my whole body jerks into the air, plunged into a whirlpool of pleasant feelings.
4965:While watching to see my reaction, Bibi slowly begins moving her hands.
4966:BibiÅgHow is this? I can pleasure you with all my hands at once... You could never get this from a human.Åh
4967:BibiÅgHaa, ngh, I can stroke your shaft... caress your glans... rub your balls... and tickle your anus...Åh
4968:ShinkÅgKuaaa!Åh
4969:BibiÅgHaha, was that too stimulating after all? I'm not stopping though...Åh
4970:Bibi holds down my trembling penis as she incessantly stimulates me all over.
4971:Her soft hands play with me in four places at once, surrounding my waist in unbelievable pleasure.
4972:BibiÅgOh dear, you're already getting wet. Heh, your cock can't resist me at all...Åh
4973:BibiÅgAre you enjoying yourself? You're leaking out so much... Do my hands feel that good?Åh
4974:ShinkÅgKuh... Haaa...Åh
4975:Precum smears all over my glans in front of my eyes as my shaft twitches in her grasp.
4976:One of her hands uses its fingers to play with my sticky juice as the others continue stimulating me.
4977:BibiÅgHehe, putting out so much juice this early... These balls of yours are acting very naughty...Åh
4978:BibiÅgHow about this... If I rub them right here, hehe look, your cock leaps into the air.Åh
4979:ShinkÅgUgggh, kuaaa!Åh
4980:Each time Bibi massages my testicles, I can feel more fluid gushing out of them.
4981:Seeing that, Bibi gives me a wry smile and continues playing with the ever-increasing amount of juices.
4982:BibiÅgNghaaa... If I give your shaft a squeeze, I can tell that more precum is on its way.Åh
4983:BibiÅgYou're feeling good, aren't you professor? It's all flowing from below to the tip, right through here...Åh
4984:ShinkÅgUgh, haaaa!Åh
4985:The stimulation isn't all that intense, but just listening to Bibi is enough to keep my dick twitching and spasming.
4986:I don't know why this is so arousing, but right now I'm drowning in a sea of ecstasy.
4987:BibiÅgWatch this... Ngh, I'll paint your glans with your own precum...Åh
4988:ShinkÅgKuhaa, ugh... That's too...!Åh
4989:BibiÅgGood, right? Hehe, ahaha, your squirming is pitifully cute... You act just like a child.Åh
I added the 'cute.' Might be inappropriate for Bibi
4990:BibiÅgNo, I bet a child could endure longer. Ha, you're weaker than a child, professor.Åh
4991:ShinkÅgNnngh, haa...Åh
4992:Despite Bibi making fun of me, even those embarrassing words are nothing but fuel for my erection.
4993:An urge begins building up from deep inside me, and my waist begins to shake along with my twitching penis.
4994:BibiÅgAhaha, why are you so eager... There's no need to hurry. Here...Åh
4995:BibiÅgSemen... flows from your balls... Then I'll stroke your shaft to make it ascend... and finally play with your glans.Åh
4996:ShinkÅgAaah, kuaaa!Åh
4997:Her successive stimulation brings me to my limit in the blink of an eye.
4998:Thinking to help along the process, I thrust my waist in unison with Bibi's stroking motions.
4999:BibiÅgHaha, it's swelling so much. Your cock is pushing back against my hand. It looks like it'll erupt at any second.Åh
5000:ShinkÅgGuh, Bibi... Haa, I can't... any longer...!Åh
5001:BibiÅgYeah, I can tell... So you're going to shoot out your semen even though all I've done is grope and play with you a little?Åh
5002:BibiÅgHaha, then come as much as you want. As soon as you have, I'll begin squeezing out even more...Åh
5003:ShinkÅgGuh, kuaaa!Åh
5004:Despite my moans, Bibi doesn't loosen her grip at all. Rather, she relishes in stimulating my dick.
5005:Completely swallowed up in a whirlpool of pleasure, I thrust my hips forward as I'm about to get what I desire.
5006:BibiÅgJust kidding... Did you expect me to let you come that easily?Åh
5007:ShinkÅg...ugh!?Åh
5008:At the last possible moment, Bibi squeezes the base of my dick and stops my ejaculation.
5009:Denied its release, my dick lets out its frustrations by twitching and spasming in Bibi's hands.
5010:ShinkÅgAaaagh... Why...!Åh
5011:BibiÅgWhat do you mean "why?" This is my reward, isn't it? It won't do for you to come so early.Åh
5012:BibiÅgI'm the one who gets to decide when you come. Let me hear your pitiful moans so I can enjoy the semen you've saved up for me.Åh
5013:ShinkÅgAgh, unnngh!Åh
5014:While expressing her lack of concern for my comfort, Bibi continues stroking me.
5015:Her palm squeezes the tip of my penis, and another hand fondles my sperm-filled balls that aren't allowed to release.
5016:My head pounds and my vision wavers as my frustration builds up more and more.
5017:BibiÅgHeheh, how does it feel wanting to come but not being able to? Irritating? Or maybe wonderful...?Åh
5018:ShinkÅgThere's no way... this could feel... wonderful!Åh
5019:I answer Bibi's teasing question, but on top of the frustration, there is actually a part of this that feels great.
5020:And even though I'm aghast once I realize that, I still end up thrusting my hips upwards for more of Bibi's stimulation.
5021:ShinkÅgKuhaaaa, unngh!Åh
5022:BibiÅgHaha, you may say that, but it looks like you're enjoying it. Your cock is trembling and twitching even more than ever.Åh
5023:BibiÅgJust admit it, professor. It really does feel good when I play with you and keep you from coming, doesn't it?Åh
5024:ShinkÅgHnngh, gaaah... I can't...Åh
5025:Given the situation, I can't even put together a reply to her question.
5026:It didn't help that the second she asked, she squeezed my balls and began poking the end of my urethra with her fingertip.
5027:BibiÅgHeheh, hahaha! That's it, professor! That's the kind of reaction I like to see.Åh
5028:BibiÅgI knew you'd be promising for a human, but... Hehe, I'm happy to have underestimated you.Åh
A happy miscalculation
5029:BibiÅgHere... In reward for pleasing me, let me give you even more pleasure...Åh
5030:ShinkÅgAaah... kuaaa!Åh
5031:As she laughs, I think I feel her fingers playing with my butt moving when suddenly a sharp pain runs through my anus.
5032:In an instant, an intense pleasure shoots up my spine, and my balls struggle to release a huge glob of semen.
5033:BibiÅgOops, not yet you don't. So how is this? The sensation of my finger up your ass feels good, doesn't it?Åh
5034:BibiÅgThis is the hand I use for daily activities, you know. I wonder what I've been doing with it...Åh
5035:BibiÅgLicking it, perhaps? Or maybe masturbating with it...?Åh
5036:ShinkÅgAaah, nngh!Åh
5037:Bibi skillfully fills my head with imagined scenarios. Due to the pain, I can't focus on blocking them out.
5038:With every word I hear, the possibility that she's telling the truth becomes my center of attention.
5039:BibiÅgLooks like you're enjoying it... so let me dial it up another notch. Hang in there, professor...Åh
5040:ShinkÅgKuaaa!Åh
5041:Several more fingers are inserted into my anus, reaching in to dig around in my rectum.
5042:As my penis trembles in pleasure, Bibi plunges her fingertip further down my urethra.
5043:Sharp pains attack my body from above and below, but rather than hurt, my body treats them as pleasant feelings.
5044:BibiÅgAhaha! What a reaction! Are you feeling that good from me stretching out your ass and opening your pee hole?Åh
5045:BibiÅgFascinating... Heheh, your cock keeps swelling larger and larger...Åh
5046:BibiÅgIt's getting hotter too. It almost feels like it's going to burn my hand...Åh
5047:Bibi laughs with wild abandon as she strokes my penis and expands my anus.
5048:I'm nearly about to lose consciousness from her sexual torture.
5049:ShinkÅgAaaah, nnngh!Åh
5050:BibiÅgHeheh, what? Giving up already? Humans really are fragile.Åh
5051:BibiÅgYou did manage to entertain me though... So I'll finally let you come... Here!Åh
5052:With a firm grip still on the base of my dick, Bibi repositions my balls and tip and furiously strokes my shaft.
5053:ShinkÅgAaagh, nnngh... It hurts... but why does it feel so...Åh
5054:BibiÅgThe opposite of pain is pleasure... Aah, it's so easy to manipulate your feelings, professor.Åh
5055:BibiÅgCome on, shake your hips! Shake them like a monkey! Disgrace yourself and blow your load!Åh
5056:Bibi urges me on with a fierce smile on her face.
5057:As if all the earlier pain has disappeared, Bibi's stimulation is nothing but pure pleasure to me now.
5058:ShinkÅgNgh, aaaah! Bibi... Let go... Let me come!Åh
5059:I'm at the limits of what I can take. I bow my head in submission to Bibi and beg her to let me ejaculate.
5060:If I wait any longer than this, I'm going to go mad...
5061:BibiÅgHeheh, ahahaha!Åh
5062:BibiÅgWow, I never thought you'd bow to me. Even though you're a professor, I've literally got you by the balls.Åh
5063:ShinkÅgKuhaaa... ungh...Åh
5064:BibiÅgWell, that's enough talk. It's the moment you've been waiting for!Åh
5065:Bibi flashes me a big grin and tightly squeezes my balls.
5066:The moment the shock reaches the base of my penis, Bibi relaxes her grip and lets go.
5067:ShinkÅgAaah, nnnnngh, c-coming!!Åh
5068:BibiÅgNghaa, haha... Such thick semen... You've been saving up...Åh
5069:BibiÅgIt smells so strong, and it's really gushing out... Now I just need more... Come on!Åh
5070:ShinkÅgUwaaa!!Åh
5071:Basking in the afterglow of orgasm, I'm unprepared for the sudden jolt in my rectum that jerks my whole body up with a start.
5072:Despite having just ejaculated, the stimulation sends another eruption of semen boiling up from down below.
5073:ShinkÅgAaaaah!!Åh
5074:BibiÅgNngh, aaaah... What an amazing amount of it... My whole face is painted white...Åh
5075:BibiÅgJust smelling your semen makes me feel dizzy. This is really some high quality essence...Åh
5076:BibiÅgHehe, aaah... Ssspst, mmmchp... I like the taste too...Åh
5077:BibiÅgNow I want even more of it...Åh
5078:Bibi mutters to herself as if in a trance as she licks my semen off her face.
5079:However, she still has the presence of mind to keep me pinned in a sitting position.
5080:ShinkÅgUgh, haaa... Haa...Åh
5081:BibiÅgAha, mmmpch... That felt good, didn't it? So once more, be mine...Åh
5082:ShinkÅg...haaa, I can't.Åh
5083:Even though I can barely muster enough breath to speak, I manage to say that clearly.
5084:No matter what she does to me, I won't agree to that.
5085:BibiÅgAhaha, I see... Hahahahaha!Åh
5086:Bibi reaction to my answer is to simply laugh over and over as she wipes the semen off her face.
5087:ShinkÅgTch, why did you put me through that...Åh
5088:BibiÅgHmm, it wasn't very effective, was it? I didn't expect you to be so strong-willed.Åh
5089:ShinkÅgWhy? To begin with, there's no way I'd obey you just because you...Åh
5090:BibiÅgI see... Because Rin, Comet, and Shirene are already meeting your needs?Åh
5091:ShinkÅgWh-what!Åh
5092:That certainly gets my attention in a hurry.
5093:I haven't told anymore, and I really doubt any of those three have either...
5094:So how the hell does she know?!
5095:BibiÅgHeheh, I have a better nose than most, especially for this kind of thing.Åh
5096:BibiÅgYou've been having sex about once a month, right? After a man does it, he has a particular smell on him that I can sense.Åh
5097:BibiÅgAnyway, I haven't told anybody. I've shown you that much mercy, at least. Although others besides me have probably noticed.Åh
5098:ShinkÅgWha...!?Åh
5099:Is she serious? What a pointless ability...
5100:Wait, hold on... Does that mean... the other teachers...
5101:Shink
5102:ÅgUwaaaa!Åh
5103:BibiÅgHaha, you don't need to trouble yourself over that. If you become mine, it won't be a problem at all.Åh
5104:ShinkÅgI told you I can't, no matter how many times you ask.Åh
5105:BibiÅgHmm, so that's your final answer? I guess there's nothing more I can do now.Åh
5106:BibiÅgOh well, I have plenty of time. I can afford to be patient.Åh
5107:BibiÅgKeep this in mind though: I'm a poor loser, especially when it comes to things I desire.Åh
5108:ShinkÅg...*gulp*Åh
5109:In other words, she isn't going to give up pursuing me?
5110:BibiÅgSooner or later, I'll make you mine, professor.Åh
5111:ShinkÅgHey, hold on!Åh
5112:With that ultimatum, Bibi heads back into the school building.
5113:I'm left standing on the roof by myself wondering how I should proceed from here...
5114:ShinkÅg...sigh.Åh
5115:I don't even know how long I stand there dumbfounded without thinking of a solution.
5116:ShinkÅgYaaaaaawn...Åh
5117:By dinner time, I'm exhausted and still haven't made sense of my thoughts.
5118:RinÅgProfessor Shink, are you all right? Are you worried about something that happened earlier...?Åh
Bleh?
5119:ShinkÅgOh, aah... No, nothing like that...Åh
5120:CometÅgLiar. Bibi either said something or did something to you. You can't fool me.Åh
5121:ShireneÅgWhat in the world did Bibi ask for to make you look so troubled?Åh
5122:MiritaÅgYou could always refuse if she asked for too much...Åh
5123:VeraÅgI bet I know what it was... Heheh, this must be hard on you, Shink.Åh
5124:ShinkÅgUgh...Åh
5125:While everyone else worries over me, Vera flashes me a smile as if she knows everything already.
5126:Is there anything she isn't a master of?
5127:BibiÅgOh, are we all eating together? It's good to see everyone getting along.Åh
5128:ShinkÅg...oh.Åh
5129:Bibi walks over to our table with an innocent look on her face.
5130:I don't know why, but I have a bad feeling about this...
5131:My intuition has been sharpened considerably since I've been teaching here, and it's telling me to run away as fast as I can.
5132:ShinkÅgWell then, it's been nice eating with you girls...Åh
5133:BibiÅgAh, settle down, professor. I'm impressed with your intuition, but you can't run away from me that easily.Åh
5134:ShinkÅgUgh...Åh
5135:RinÅgH-hold on, Bibi. Just what did you end up asking him for?Åh
5136:ShireneÅgSomething big enough that makes Shink want to avoid her, apparently.Åh
5137:CometÅgWhat are you scheming...Åh
5138:BibiÅgYou're all so mean. Whatever, I was planning to tell you anyway so I guess it's fine.Åh
5139:MiritaÅgVera, I've got a bad feeling about this.Åh
5140:VeraÅgI'm right, aren't I? Well, this doesn't seem to concern Mirita and I.Åh
5141:BibiÅgHmm? I suppose it doesn't involve the two of you.Åh
5142:Bibi chuckles at Mirita and Vera and turns to face the other three girls at the table.
5143:In return, each of them reacts to Bibi's provoking stare with stern expressions of their own.
5144:BibiÅgWell, it looks like you all already understand. The professor is going to be mine. Give up on him.Åh
5145:ShinkÅgWhoa!Åh
5146:Even though I knew what she was going to say, I didn't expect her to be so direct!
5147:Perhaps because all three of them are together, they each act surprised.
5148:However, those expressions soon turn to anger as the meaning of Bibi's words begins to set in.
5149:RinÅgBibi...? What are you talking about?Åh
5150:BibiÅgYou get it, don't you? I wanted to tell you all at the same time.Åh
This could be totally wrong, but fits Comet's next line better than alternatives.
5151:CometÅgIn other words, we have a new rival... You have some nerve.Åh
5152:BibiÅgA rival... Heheh, come on Comet, do you really think you can be my rival?Åh
5153:CometÅgTch. Flaunting your giant lumps of flesh, what an indecent bitch.Åh
5154:ShireneÅgI don't know why you're telling me this. I don't care what you do.Åh
5155:BibiÅgOh, if you don't realize it... My apologies. If you don't want any part of this, that makes it easier for me.Åh
Pretty sure Bibi is referring to Shirene not being aware of her own feelings for Shink.
5156:ShireneÅgDo as you like then?Åh
5157:RinÅgAaaah, Professor Shink! What's going on here!?Åh
5158:ShinkÅgHey, stop shaking me please...Åh
This could be figurative, like "don't give up on me" "don't dump me" or some such, but I think it's more likely that she's physically shaking him tha he's asking her for some kind of help.
5159:Whatever you do, keep it amongst yourselves. Leave me out of it.
5160:Oh well, nothing I say matters now. Do whatever you want...
5161:CometÅgIt looks like the professor has entered surrender mode. Now's my chance!Åh
5162:RinÅgAre you trying to get the jump on me!? I won't lose to either of you!Åh
5163:BibiÅgHeh, interesting. In that case, let's make it a game.Åh
5164:BibiÅgThe first person who can catch the professor's eye wins, and the losers can't complain, okay?Åh
5165:CometÅgBring it on. I look forward to seeing you in tears.Åh
5166:RinÅgI, I'm in too!Åh
5167:ShireneÅgNot that I care, but am I included in this too?Åh
5168:VeraÅgOoh? I thought you weren't interested, Shirene?Åh
5169:ShireneÅgAnd how about you, Vera?Åh
5170:VeraÅgMe? Ahaha, you're kidding. I might consider it if Shink were cooler than my dad though.Åh
5171:MiritaÅgAh, you never change, do you Vera...Åh
5172:ShinkÅgThat's enough punishment for me today. I'm out of here.Åh
5173:While watching Rin bicker with the others, I address the comparatively cheerful Vera and stand up from my seat.
5174:This is likely to blow over soon enough. I'm off to bed.
5175:It might be seen as trying to hide from reality, but I do need sleep anyway.
5176:RinÅgAh, where do you think you're going!Åh
5177:CometÅgLooks like he's running away. But that's fine for now, the problem is here.Åh
5178:BibiÅgOoh, so that means earlier... I was right? I have such good judgment.Åh
5179:...sigh.
5180:Why did it have to turn out this way...
5181:I head back to my room with the feeling that it's only going to get worse from now on.
5182:It's almost summer break though. Maybe things will settle down then?
5183:I know that's simply wishful thinking. However, I had no idea at the time just how wishful it was...
5184:ShinkÅgMan, it's so hot...Åh
5185:With exams over, summer vacation has come to the academy, which means peaceful days for me.
5186:Well, maybe not entirely peaceful, but having most of the students away visiting family is a welcome respite.
5187:ShinkÅgThis heat is unbearable though.Åh
5188:I know it's supposed to be hot in summer, but that doesn't stop me from feeling depressed when I think about every day being like this.
5189:KyuteÅgCome on, it may be summer break and all, but you can't slack off this much.Åh
5190:ShinkÅgAh, I'm sorry. You're right, but still...Åh
5191:KyuteÅgDon't worry, I know how you feel.Åh
5192:Kyute can't hide her knowing smile as she reassures me.
5193:She doesn't show it on her face, but I bet she's burning up too.
5194:ShinkÅgSo anyway, how's Rin doing? I've heard that she doesn't do well in the heat.Åh
5195:KyuteÅgIt hasn't been that bad on her. She's certainly getting along better this year than usual.Åh
5196:KyuteÅgActually, she seems to have been in good health ever since you arrived. I wonder what that has to do with it?Åh
5197:ShinkÅgUm...Åh
5198:I glance away so I don't have to look Kyute straight in the eyes.
5199:Now that I think about it, that did happen right at the start of the new semester...
5200:Am I jumping to conclusions to think that her weak constitution is simply a lack of life essence?
Translating ê∏ãC is a pain. Vitality, energy, etc. sound too physical when he's really talking about a lack of semen in her.
5201:ShinkÅgWhatever the cause, it's good that she's doing well. I'll have to pay her a visit after this.Åh
5202:KyuteÅgHehe, I'm sure Rin will be delighted to see you.Åh
5203:Kyute and I spend an hour or two relaxing and talking about nothing particularly important.
5204:Even though I've been looking forward to this break for awhile, I feel like being lazy and doing nothing.
5205:ShinkÅgHey Kyute, you aren't going home for a vacation?Åh
5206:KyuteÅgI was thinking of visiting sooner or later, but I don't know whether my parents would be there or not.Åh
5207:ShinkÅgYour father is the principal, right? That reminds me, I haven't actually met him.Åh
5208:KyuteÅgYou haven't? Well, he's a busy man and spends most of his time at our sister school. It isn't so weird that you haven't met him yet.Åh
5209:ShinkÅgMakes sense.Åh
5210:Unlike this academy, the sister school only has humans in attendance.
5211:Before I became a teacher here, I heard that the principal's eventual plan is for coeducation.
5212:So between coordination and training, he has a lot on his plate.
5213:KyuteÅgHow about you, Shink? You aren't going home either?Åh
5214:ShinkÅgWell... They send letters keeping me up to date, but they also told me not to come home until I've made a man of myself.Åh
Maybe Shink is sending the letters keeping them up to date? First half of the sentence is active, second is passive, but no subjects are used. Guess it doesn't matter either way.
5215:My parents are very strict, but I understand where they're coming from.
5216:KyuteÅgThey aren't concerned about you at all? I mean, you're here at a school full of monsters by yourself.Åh
5217:ShinkÅgI'm not sure. They probably have their own opinions on it, but they respect what I'm trying to do.Åh
5218:KyuteÅgIs that so? It sounds like you have excellent parents.Åh
5219:ShinkÅgAhaha, yeah I'm proud to be their son.Åh
5220:I think about my parents while I laugh and realize I'd better write them another letter.
5221:VeraÅgKyute, Kyute, why don't we go to the beach!? Actually, I've already decided I'm going! Let's head there now!!Åh
5222:ShinkÅgAnd she appears out of nowhere as usual. The dining hall has doors, by the way. How about using one of them?Åh
5223:I let out an exasperated smile as I admonish Vera for coming in through a window.
5224:I may have gotten used to her erratic behavior, but I can't help thinking she should use the doors that the architects went to the trouble of designing.
5225:VeraÅgWha? Shink's here too?Åh
5226:ShinkÅgWas I beneath your notice?Åh
5227:KyuteÅgDon't be rude, Vera.Åh
5228:VeraÅgAhaha, sorry, sorry. Forget about that, let's go to the beach! The beach!Åh
5229:KyuteÅgLook here...Åh
5230:ShinkÅgHahaha, Vera's still energetic even when it's this hot.Åh
5231:VeraÅg'Course! It isn't really that hot though. This feels like heaven compared to the desert kingdom I went to once.Åh
Literally "sand world"
5232:ShinkÅgDesert kingdom...? Just what kind of life have you had...Åh
5233:There isn't a desert kingdom anywhere in the seven seas that I've ever heard of...
5234:I know that her parents are pirates, but I'm surprised even they have been to such a place. I shake my head at her absurd lifestyle.
5235:KyuteÅgI can't go with you at such short notice. Go ask someone else.Åh
5236:VeraÅgEhhh, I didn't think you would, but shouldn't you come and learn how to swim?Åh
5237:KyuteÅgUgh... I'm fine. I can fly, after all.Åh
5238:ShinkÅgWait, you can't swim?Åh
5239:That's kind of surprising.
5240:KyuteÅgIt, it's not that I can't swim, just that my ability to fly is much stronger or...Åh
5241:VeraÅgThat's nothing but an excuse. Excuses are dumb.Åh
5242:ShinkÅgWell, everyone has a thing or two they're not any good at.Åh
5243:KyuteÅgTh-that's right!Åh
5244:VeraÅgI don't.Åh
5245:ShinkÅgYou're a special case.Åh
5246:VeraÅgYou mean it? I've always thought so myself.Åh
5247:ShinkÅgThat wasn't meant as a compliment...Åh
5248:Vera shows amazing self-confidence as always.
5249:KyuteÅgA-anyway! Going to the beach is a great idea, but make sure to come back, okay?Åh
5250:VeraÅgOf course! Things have become really fun around here so I'll definitely return!Åh
5251:KyuteÅgThat's good to hear at least.Åh
5252:Kyute lets out a sigh with a slightly worried expression on her face.
5253:It's natural to be concerned, but when the person in question says she'll be all right, it probably will be.
5254:I don't think Vera would lie...
5255:But just thinking of my own childhood, I also get the urge to worry about her.
bleh
5256:ShinkÅgOh, look at the time. Please excuse me, I've got things to do today.Åh
5257:KyuteÅgAh, that's fine. Go check on Rin today, okay?Åh
5258:ShinkÅgDefinitely. And Vera, don't do anything reckless, all right?Åh
5259:VeraÅgI won't. Don't underestimate me.Åh
5260:ShinkÅgYeah yeah.Åh
5261:I stand up from the table while exchanging a few words with Vera.
5262:I guess I'll go see Rin first and then take care of everything else before dinner.
5263:ShinkÅgHi, Rin. Are you feeling well?Åh
5264:RinÅgAh, Professor shink! Yes, I'm doing just fine... *cough*Åh
5265:ShinkÅgOh come on, don't push yourself. Sit back down and relax.Åh
5266:RinÅgB-but... You came all the way here to see me.Åh
5267:ShinkÅgDon't worry about that. It'd be a counter-productive visit if I caused you to get worse, wouldn't it?Åh
5268:RinÅgOh... I'm sorry.Åh
5269:I came to check on Rin's health, but she tried to get up when I came in and strained herself.
5270:I hastily force her back down and take a seat beside her before handing over a few items from the dining hall.
5271:ShinkÅgSo how have you been lately? Kyute says you're holding up all right.Åh
5272:RinÅgAh, yes. It's not so bad. My fever is nothing compared to how it normally is.Åh
5273:ShinkÅgThat's good to hear. It'd be a shame if you couldn't enjoy your summer vacation.Åh
5274:RinÅgY-yeah... That really would be a shame.Åh
5275:ShinkÅg...??Åh
5276:Huh? The second I mentioned summer vacation, Rin blushed and stole a few embarrassed glances my way.
5277:Is there something she wants to say to me?
5278:RinÅgUmm, Professor Shink? Are you going anywhere over the break?Åh
5279:ShinkÅgWell, I haven't made any particular plans. If I do, I'll probably go shopping or something...Åh
5280:RinÅgOh! If, if you do, then please...Åh
5281:CometÅgOh no you don't! TA-DA! Comet has arrived.Åh
5282:ShinkÅgWhoa...!Åh
5283:RinÅgC-comet!?Åh
5284:CometÅgYep. Comet. Always on guard.Åh
5285:ShinkÅgWait, when did you...!?Åh
5286:Did she come out from under Rin's bed?
5287:Vera is a lost cause, but can everyone else appear normally at least?
5288:CometÅgI was trying to be unpredictable. Mission accomplished. Well done, well done.Åh
5289:RinÅgComet, when did you come into my room?Åh
5290:CometÅgWhile you were asleep. I had a bad feeling so I waited here.Åh
5291:ShinkÅgWaited here? Sounds more like breaking and entering to me.Åh
5292:CometÅgYou could say that too. Rin's solo performance was worth the price of admission though.Åh
5293:RinÅgC-Comet!? Y-you were watching that!?Åh
5294:CometÅgThe whole thing. I remember every line, word for word. If you'd like, I could perform it back for you.Åh
5295:RinÅgDon't! Anything but that!Åh
5296:ShinkÅgHey now, Rin's sick. You shouldn't stir her up, Comet.Åh
5297:CometÅgHmm, that's true. I agree with your assessment.Åh
5298:As if convinced, Comet sits down beside us and takes out a pastry.
5299:Come to think of it, I haven't paid attention before, but how does she even eat?
5300:I sit with her all the time in the dining hall, but her food always just disappears when I'm not looking.
5301:I can't imagine she manages that using her mouth. That time in my bedroom, everything leaked out from beneath her head too...
5302:CometÅgHmm? I sense someone having erotic thoughts. Pervert teacher.Åh
5303:ShinkÅgHold on! What makes you jump to that conclusion?!Åh
5304:RinÅgP-professor Shink... Is, is that why you came to visit me... Eeek.Åh
5305:ShinkÅgOf course not!? Why are you turning red?!Åh
5306:Comet wasn't entirely incorrect though. How did she know!?
5307:CometÅgAnytime you want, professor. I'm always ready.Åh
5308:ShinkÅgDon't you have any shame!?Åh
5309:RinÅgOh, of course not, huh...Åh
5310:ShinkÅgWhy do you sound so disappointed, Rin?Åh
5311:Damn these girls! Why are they after me so hard?
5312:I know they aren't joking around either, which makes it even worse.
5313:CometÅgTch, I knew I shouldn't have tried to strike with another girl around...Åh
5314:ShinkÅgHow about you don't try anything when I'm alone either...Åh
5315:CometÅgHey professor, want to go to the library?Åh
5316:ShinkÅgWhat do you think?Åh
5317:CometÅgI can't believe I was refused. I'm surprised.Åh
5318:ShinkÅgThe surprising thing is that you were thinking I'd nod my head and go along.Åh
5319:CometÅgOh well, I'm done for the day.Åh
5320:RinÅgAh, bye bye, Comet. You don't need to be here any longer then, right?Åh
5321:RinÅgIt's time for Professor Shink and I to spend some quality time together. Shoo, shoo.Åh
5322:ShinkÅgWhat in the world, Rin!?Åh
5323:Shoo, shoo? Since when is Rin capable of saying something so mean!?
5324:CometÅgI would very much like to go, but unfortunately, my body is not cooperating.Åh
5325:What's with the monotone voice...
5326:RinÅgShoot... You really aren't going to leave us alone, are you?Åh
5327:CometÅgNaturally not. I can speak while I sleep. It might sound like the solo performance I heard earlier.Åh
wtf is this line? êQåæÇÕêQÇƒåæÇ¶
5328:RinÅgFine... I give up. By the way, are you not going anywhere either, Comet?Åh
5329:Rin sighs and changes the subject as she realizes the futility of convincing Comet to leave.
5330:Comet nods back at Rin, and seemingly from thin air, pulls out a book to look through.
5331:CometÅgNot really. It's more constructive to stay here and catch up on my reading. Unless the professor wants to invite me somewhere.Åh
5332:ShinkÅgNo, I don't feel like going anywhere either...Åh
5333:CometÅgThen I don't have any plans to leave. How about you, Rin?Åh
5334:RinÅgUmm, me neither. I didn't intend to visit home.Åh
5335:RinÅgAh! Of course, if Professor Shink were to invite me out, I'd gladly accept his offer!Åh
5336:ShinkÅgI haven't changed my mind in the last 15 seconds.Åh
5337:Do they want to go somewhere with me so badly that they'll ignore the fact that I said I wasn't interested?
5338:I'm too scared of what would happen afterwards to go anywhere alone with one of them anyway.
5339:CometÅgIn the end, we're still the group that gets left behind. Even breaks are no different.Åh
Reference to repeating years in school and how they're left at school during vacations too. I think?
5340:RinÅgYeah, I guess so. At least as long as Professor Shink is here, I'm okay with that.Åh
5341:CometÅgI agree. However, I think he might end up going somewhere.Åh
5342:ShinkÅgWhy do you make that sound so ominous...Åh
5343:Cut it out. Now it really does seem like I'll be making a trip outside the academy...
5344:RinÅgAah, someone else might invite him out. Please be careful, Professor Shink.Åh
5345:CometÅgDon't accept any invitations without thinking, and if you get one, contact me first.Åh
5346:ShinkÅgWhy do I need your permission...Åh
5347:RinÅgAhaha. If you do go out, I'd love to accompany you.Åh
5348:ShinkÅgAh, well... If I end up going somewhere...Åh
5349:CometÅgFlag set.Åh
VN flag joke. Lots of those in here. I guess people will get it? If you've never read a walkthrough for a VN, maybe not.
5350:ShinkÅg......Åh
5351:This is bad. I almost can't avoid it at this point.
5352:I continue talking with Rin and Comet for awhile with that mulling around in the back of my mind.
5353:ShinkÅgWow, it's already this late?Åh
5354:Noticing the reddening sky outside my window, I stand up, stretch out my arms, and yawn.
5355:I must have been really lost in concentration.
5356:ShinkÅgHmm? What's that sound...Åh
5357:I hear something that sounds like it's zipping through the air from outside.
5358:On top of that, I think it's getting closer...
5359:ShinkÅgWhoa, what the!?Åh
5360:ShinkÅgGuuuh... Aaaaaaah!?Åh
5361:It hurts, it hurts, it hurts!! There's something sticking into me!
5362:It looks like... a tail... no, a stinger?
5363:BibiÅgOops, missed my landing. Actually, it's your fault for standing in front of the window.Åh
5364:ShinkÅgHow is that my fault!? Forget it. I'm sick of all of you making these crazy entrances!!Åh
5365:BibiÅgAll of us...? What's the big deal? It's perfectly normal for flying monsters to come in through the window.Åh
5366:ShinkÅgThat's not normal at all! Windows are not entrances!Åh
5367:BibiÅgMaybe where you come from they're not. Anyway, calm down, I'm still stuck in you.Åh
5368:ShinkÅgGyaaa!? Don't move!? That really hurts!Åh
5369:Bibi begins wriggling her body trying to get her stinger out of mine.
5370:But each time she moves, it bites into my flesh and sends a searing pain through my whole body.
5371:ShinkÅgDamn, this is bad! Stop moving! I'm dying, I'm going to die!!Åh
FIXME Too bland.
5372:BibiÅgThere's no way you're going to die. I'm not injecting any venom so there's no danger. It just hurts, deal with it.Åh
5373:ShinkÅgVenom!?Åh
5374:What?? Bibi is venomous!?
5375:BibiÅgArgh, shut up and hold still!Åh
5376:ShinkÅgGyaaaaa!!!Åh
5377:Ignoring my concern, Bibi floats off the ground and jerks backwards.
5378:I scream as a sharp pain runs through me, but at least the stinger slides out.
5379:ShinkÅgHaa, haa... What a day...Åh
5380:I catch my breath and try to calm down while rubbing the painful spot on my chest.
5381:I wonder how long this is going to keep hurting...
5382:BibiÅgHmm, rubbing your body while panting... Are you sexually frustrated?Åh
5383:ShinkÅgI don't want to hear that from you!Åh
5384:BibiÅgI was wrong then? That's a pity. I was hoping to squeeze you dry again...Åh
5385:ShinkÅgHey now...Åh
5386:Bibi looks extremely disappointed, which has me shocked speechless.
Bleh.
5387:I could ask her to reflect on her actions or at least apologize, but that wouldn't accomplish anything.
5388:ShinkÅgAnyway, why did you even come here?Åh
5389:BibiÅgNo particular reason, I suppose. If I had to say, I wanted to know whether you were going somewhere for break or not.Åh
5390:ShinkÅgYou too, huh...Åh
5391:Why is everyone coming to visit me asking that today?
5392:Are they that interested in what I'm up to?
5393:BibiÅgMmm, I'm not the first to ask? I was worried about that, but did they beat me to the punch?Åh
5394:ShinkÅgThere was nothing to beat you to. I don't have plans to go anywhere.Åh
5395:BibiÅgIs that so? That's no good... Should I kidnap you?Åh
5396:ShinkÅgDon't even think about it.Åh
5397:How can she say something so startling that nonchalantly...
5398:I feel like danger has taken on a new meaning since I came to this academy.
5399:BibiÅgWho asked you about your plans, by the way? Rin and Comet?Åh
5400:ShinkÅgYeah, Kyute too. And Vera, I guess?Åh
5401:No, Vera didn't actually ask me out. She doesn't count.
5402:BibiÅgProfessor Kyute and Vera? More and more surprises... Wait, are you going somewhere with either of them?Åh
5403:ShinkÅg...? What's wrong with you?Åh
5404:BibiÅgNothing, but if you go out with Kyute, that could be a problem... If you pick Vera... then, no...Åh
5405:ShinkÅg......Åh
5406:Bibi seems completely lost in thought.
5407:She's mumbling some occasionally disturbing things, but I don't think she'll try anything in my own room...
5408:ShireneÅgPardon me... Oh, you're not alone?Åh
5409:ShinkÅgAh, Shirene? How's it going?Åh
5410:ShireneÅgI, I'm fine... I was just wondering if you had any plans for the break...Åh
5411:ShinkÅgYou too? I really am a popular guy today.Åh
5412:I'm happy that I'm so well-liked by my students, but under the circumstances, I'm not too thrilled with the attention...
5413:ShireneÅgOh, then your schedule is already booked solid? I was hoping you wouldn't mind helping me train.Åh
5414:ShinkÅgTrain? I don't think I'd be too useful to you...Åh
5415:More importantly, she actually plans to spend her vacation training?
5416:That sounds kind of lonely...
5417:ShireneÅgWhy does it look like you're pitying me?Åh
5418:ShinkÅgSorry, it's just that you don't get a lot of breaks from school, and...Åh
5419:ShireneÅgHow rude. Even I have plans to travel, you know.Åh
5420:ShinkÅgOh, I didn't expect that.Åh
5421:ShireneÅgI'm going back home for the second half of vacation. I have to at least show my face there.Åh
5422:ShinkÅgMakes sense. That's perfectly normal.Åh
5423:Finally, a student who's doing something normal on her vacation.
5424:All of these girls are asking about nothing but my plans though...
5425:ShireneÅgAnyway... While I'm here, I was thinking it wouldn't be bad to spend some time with you...Åh
5426:ShinkÅgI understand. Then I'd be glad to...Åh
5427:I suppose hanging out with Shirene is fine. After all, she isn't thinking of doing anything weird like the other girls.
5428:BibiÅgHold it right there. What are you doing deciding on these things without me? Looks like I can't let my guard down for a second.Åh
5429:ShireneÅgI didn't think I needed to get your permission, Bibi.Åh
5430:BibiÅgNo, you do. The professor is mine so you have to ask me first.Åh
5431:ShinkÅgI don't belong to anyone, and I don't plan on it in the future either.Åh
5432:I'm the one who can't let his guard down...
5433:For the next few minutes, the two bicker back and forth causing a huge commotion in my room.
5434:I wish they'd consider how this affects me for once.
5435:BibiÅgYour wishes are irrelevant, professor. If I say so, that's how it is.Åh
5436:ShinkÅgWho elected you dictator?Åh
literally "what's with that tyrant theory" Figured some kind of history/civics joke would work well for Shink.
5437:ShireneÅgYeah, really. I won't play along with this at all.Åh
5438:BibiÅgOooh? So you're acting like the rules don't apply to you? That's just like you, Shirene.Åh
FIXME might have to retranslate that line for context later.
5439:ShireneÅgHuh!? I, I have no idea what you're talking about.Åh
5440:BibiÅgHeh, I see, I see. I'd better keep an eye on you. Anyway, we must be going, professor.Åh
5441:ShireneÅgHey, let go of me! I'm not done talking with him!Åh
5442:BibiÅgBe quiet. You won't regret it, just come with me.Åh
You can trust me... literally "I won't do so that it is bad"
5443:ShinkÅgH-hey...Åh
5444:As if she hit on something during their conversation, Bibi grabs Shirene and forces her towards the door.
5445:I have no idea what it was, but Bibi seems incredibly eager to get Shirene away from me all the sudden...
5446:ShireneÅgOkay, fine! I get it, now let go!!Åh
5447:BibiÅgYou should have cooperated from the beginning. Bye professor, we'll continue our chat later.Åh
5448:ShinkÅgUh, yeah...Åh
5449:That's the last I get out of Bibi as she drags Shirene, who doesn't look very cooperative, out of my room.
5450:I'm extremely curious as to why Bibi ended the conversation so suddenly.
5451:Or maybe instead of curious, I should say worried...
5452:ShinkÅgThey're dragging me into something, aren't they?Åh
5453:I can't help but be convinced that I'm right.
5454:However, there probably isn't a single thing I can do about it besides grin and bear it.
5455:ShinkÅgSigh... Nobody treats teachers with any respect around here...Åh
5456:I gaze up at the moon and try to soothe away today's stress.
5457:It's gotten somewhat cooler at night, and the gentle breeze feels comfortable against my skin.
5458:MiritaÅgOh? What are you doing out here, professor?Åh
5459:ShinkÅgIs that you, Mirita... Yea- whoooa!?Åh
5460:MiritaÅgWhaa!? What did you scare me for!Åh
5461:ShinkÅgSorry, I didn't mean to, but what the hell Mirita!?Åh
5462:MiritaÅgHuh? Is something wrong?Åh
Bleh. Literally "is something strange?" but both sound dull
5463:I turn around in response to a girl's voice to see Mirita standing behind me looking like she's finished a hard day's work.
5464:Well, assuming that work involved getting covered in mud and scratches. That's enough to prompt a dozen questions, but first...
5465:ShinkÅgWhat in the world are you dragging behind you...Åh
5466:MiritaÅgEh? Aaah, this?Åh
5467:Beaming with pride, Mirita lifts up the strange thing I'm pointing at.
5468:She may be giving me a beautiful smile, but that doesn't assuage my concerns...
5469:MiritaÅgYou can't tell from looking at it? It's a wild boar, see?Åh
5470:ShinkÅgThe hell it is! That doesn't look like any wild boar I've ever seen!Åh
5471:Who's ever heard of a place where boars grow to over five meters long?!
5472:MiritaÅgHuuuh? They're scattered all over up past those hills.Åh
5473:ShinkÅgThat's a scary thought.Åh
5474:MiritaÅgEhehe. Mom and I used to hunt them together all the time back home.Åh
5475:ShinkÅg......Åh
5476:Come to think of it, I may actually have heard mentions of these boars...
5477:They're still way larger than I imagined. That mountain must be crazy if things like these are just wandering around on it...
5478:MiritaÅgI'm super excited at the thought of eating it with everyone! I hope they like boar though.Åh
5479:ShinkÅgYou hope they like boar? Wait, you said you're eating it??Åh
5480:MiritaÅgOf course! They're delicious when cooked, but boar meat is best served raw!Åh
5481:Shink
5482:ÅgRaw!?Åh
5483:Monsters eat raw boar?!
5484:As I stand there dumbstruck, a disturbing scene plays out in my head.
5485:All my students are gathered around the giant boar on a table, nonchalantly biting off pieces of raw meat.
5486:ShinkÅgThat's a scary thought...Åh
5487:I can't stop imagining my students with blood smeared on their faces. What a horrifying image...
5488:MiritaÅgOh? You don't want any? It's really delicious though.Åh
5489:ShinkÅgThanks, but I'll pass.Åh
5490:MiritaÅgI'm not kidding! If you think I'm trying to trick you, let's eat it and you'll see!Åh
5491:ShinkÅgH-hey now, not so close...Åh
5492:She wants me to eat it that badly? A human eating raw boar, really?
5493:Yeah, that's unthinkable. Whether it tastes good or not, I don't have the guts to find out.
5494:MiritaÅgYou won't try it for me then?Åh
5495:ShinkÅgUgh. Well, all right. If you fix a meal out of it, I suppose it wouldn't hurt to try a bite...Åh
5496:MiritaÅgReally!? Awesome! I'll go get dinner ready at once then!Åh
5497:MiritaÅgHmm, I can ask Vera for help, then I need to tell everyone else...Åh
5498:Apparently satisfied with my answer, Mirita heads for the school building dragging the giant boar behind her.
5499:Was she that happy that I wasn't able to refuse when she asked like that with her upturned eyes?
Bleh?
5500:ShinkÅgDamn, how do I get out of this...Åh
5501:PhamÅgWhy don't you just eat it?Åh
5502:ShinkÅgOh come on, raw?Åh
5503:PhamÅgI wouldn't particularly mind. I don't see any issues with eating raw boar.Åh
5504:ShinkÅgThat's easy for you to say...Åh
5505:I continue puzzling over my quandary despite Pham showing up to talk.
5506:It's so normal for her to appear without warning that I don't even bother commenting on it.
5507:PhamÅgNo reaction to my appearance? That makes me feel a bit lonely.Åh
5508:ShinkÅgI'm used to it by now. I'm out of things to say.Åh
5509:PhamÅgOh well, that's understandable. Anyway, can you even refuse them at this point? I'm sure they'd be unhappy.Åh
5510:ShinkÅgI know that. I think I have to prepare for the worst...Åh
5511:Even if I did try to refuse, I doubt they'd let me.
5512:But still, eating raw boar? I'm scared...
5513:PhamÅgThere's no need to worry yourself so much. That aside, there's something else I wanted to talk to you about.Åh
5514:ShinkÅgHuh? A serious discussion?Åh
5515:PhamÅgThat's right. Very serious and important for you to know.Åh
5516:ShinkÅgHmm...Åh
5517:Pham gives me a weighty expression quite different from anything I've ever seen from her. In reaction, I too straighten up and look serious.
5518:Judging from the way her voice changed, this must really be important.
5519:ShinkÅgSo what is it that's so crucial for me to hear?Åh
5520:PhamÅgWell... There's going to be a big choice to be made coming up very soon.Åh
5521:ShinkÅgFor me?Åh
5522:PhamÅgYes. You will have to make a weighty decision. You could call it a fork in the road that will change your future.Åh
5523:PhamÅgSo please consider carefully before choosing so you don't regret it later.Åh
5524:ShinkÅgHmm?Åh
5525:I'm confused. Is this some kind of advice, I guess?
5526:Surely there's no way anyone can see the future... Well, maybe it's possible that Pham really can.
Bleh.
5527:ShinkÅgOkay. I don't fully understand, but I'll keep it in mind.Åh
5528:PhamÅgThat's good enough. I'm very interested in seeing what happens from here on.Åh
5529:PhamÅgI'll take my leave now. You don't want to keep them waiting, do you?Åh
5530:ShinkÅgUgh...Åh
5531:Having said what she wanted to, Pham returns to her usual self and gives me a teasing smile.
5532:The look on her face immediately reminds me of my upcoming dinner, eliciting a groan.
5533:ShinkÅgI promised so I suppose there's no turning back now.Åh
5534:PhamÅgHehe, you'll have to tell me how it was next time we meet.Åh
5535:ShinkÅg...sure.Åh
5536:Ghosts don't have to eat, but it sounds like she wants to know what it tastes like.
5537:I hesitate in responding for a moment, but what does it matter?
5538:ShinkÅgWell, see you later.Åh
5539:PhamÅgUntil we meet again. Don't forget about me.Åh
5540:ShinkÅgUh huh.Åh
5541:I wave goodbye to Pham and head back into the school building.
5542:I wonder what they're going to serve with the boar...
5543:ShinkÅg...wow, what's going on here?Åh
5544:I enter the dining hall and am frozen in place at the scene unfolding before me.
5545:VeraÅgDelicious! You're the best, Mirita! This is so good!Åh
5546:RinÅgYeah! Mmmm... It's really delicious! Thank you so much, Mirita.Åh
5547:MiritaÅgAhaha, stop, you're making me blush...Åh
5548:ShireneÅgYou're really wolfing that down.Åh
5549:BibiÅgSeriously. I'll have to pass. I wasn't raised by animals.Åh
5550:VeraÅgWhaa? You two don't want any? You're missing out.Åh
5551:RinÅgThat's right. It's too good to pass up.Åh
5552:CometÅgI'm shocked that you're eating it, Rin. What about your weak constitution?Åh
5553:RinÅgI don't think eating meat has anything to do with it...Åh
5554:CometÅgI see. If you say so, that must make it true.Åh
Pretty sure Comet's line is sarcasm. It's literally "if the person in question says so, anything is fine"
5555:KyuteÅgCome on, enjoy the food without the bickering.Åh
5556:What a crazy scene. Not everyone is partaking, but the meat-eating girls are chowing down on enough for everyone.
5557:Seeing my students devour raw flesh is even more frightening than I had imagined...
5558:RinÅgAh, Professor Shink! Are you here to eat with us? Come on!Åh
5559:ShinkÅgUh, yeah. Th-that's right...Åh
5560:KyuteÅgRin... Shink is human. You can't make him eat raw meat with you.Åh
5561:Kyute, you're my savior!
5562:Am I actually going to dodge a bullet here!?
5563:MiritaÅgEh? But when I asked him earlier, he said he'd be delighted to try some.Åh
5564:ShinkÅg......Åh
5565:Me? Delighted?
5566:I don't remember saying that at all.
5567:VeraÅgOooh! Shink eats meat too!? Wow, if you appreciate the delicious taste of raw meat, I'll have to revise my opinion of you.Åh
5568:ShinkÅgUh...Åh
5569:ShireneÅgThat's amazing. I never would have expected a human to love raw meat.Åh
5570:ShinkÅgWell, I wouldn't say...Åh
5571:BibiÅgThe world doesn't make sense anymore.Åh
5572:ShinkÅgNow hold on...Åh
5573:I wish they'd stop jumping to their own conclusions.
5574:It flies in the face of all common sense to think that a human would eat raw meat.
5575:RinÅgI had heard that humans didn't eat meat raw, but I guess that's not true!Åh
5576:RinÅgI'm so glad that Shink shares our love of it!Åh
5577:ShinkÅgUhhh... Yeah, me too...Åh
5578:Wonderful. Now I definitely can't back down.
5579:MiritaÅgHere you go, professor. I cut it up so it'd be easier to eat. Enjoy.Åh
5580:ShinkÅgOh, thanks...Åh
5581:That's very considerate of her, although I wish she would have been considerate enough to not ask a human to eat raw meat in the first place...
Sentence works much better in Japanese.
5582:Come to think of it, most of them eating are half-human. How can they not realize this?
Aren't all the ones eating half-human? Vera, Mirita, Rin, Kyute. I assume Comet's not eating.
5583:KyuteÅgUmm, perhaps it'd be better if you didn't?Åh
5584:ShinkÅgI realize that, but look...Åh
5585:VeraÅgHere we go!Åh
5586:MiritaÅgHehe.Åh
5587:RinÅg*Stare*Åh
5588:ShinkÅgSee? I have to eat it.Åh
5589:KyuteÅgAhaha, it appears that way. Good luck.Åh
5590:Seeing the looks of anticipation on the three girls, Kyute realizes that I have no avenues of retreat.
5591:All I can do is prepare for the worst and eat it. I don't have the nerve to back down now.
5592:CometÅgSo manly.Åh
5593:ShinkÅgManly?Åh
5594:ShireneÅgHehe, I don't eat meat often, but even I think eating it raw is a manly thing to do.Åh
5595:BibiÅgDefinitely. I'll let you eat me like this anytime, all right?Åh
5596:ShinkÅgThat has a totally different meaning...Åh
5597:She really is a pervert, isn't she...
5598:ShinkÅgA-anyway... Bon appetit!Åh
5599:While watching for everyone's reactions, I jam the piece of meat into my mouth.
5600:Its raw taste and chewiness instantly fills my mouth. Suppressing the urge to grimace, I swallow the whole piece as fast as I can.
5601:Unfortunately, it proves difficult to swallow unchewed, and the bloody taste soaks in and lingers on my tongue.
5602:That was even worse than I imagined...
5603:VeraÅgWow, look at him eat! Shink is really scarfing it down!Åh
5604:RinÅgWhat a manly way of eating! I'm falling in love with him all over again!Åh
5605:MiritaÅgIt was worth catching that boar just to see you so happy to eat it.Åh
5606:ShinkÅg......Åh
5607:Wait a minute, was that really such a manly way to eat?
5608:And do I actually look happy when I'm trying my hardest not to vomit it back up!?
5609:KyuteÅgUh, uhhh, maybe we should let Shink...Åh
5610:CometÅgSweat is pouring off your forehead. You shouldn't push yourself.Åh
5611:ShinkÅgHah, haha... Yeah, probably not...Åh
5612:Looks like I can stop now and decline to eat any more then...
5613:BibiÅgHmm, was it really that good?Åh
5614:ShinkÅgHuh!?Åh
5615:ShireneÅgI may not understand you, but I guess it's fine if you liked it.Åh
5616:ShinkÅg...!?Åh
5617:How in the world are they coming to that conclusion from looking at me!?
5618:RinÅgH-hey! Here's some more, Professor Shink. It's delicious, isn't it?Åh
5619:Shink
5620:ÅgWhaa!?Åh
5621:VeraÅgGuess I have to give you more too! This part is especially tasty!Åh
5622:MiritaÅgAhaha, there's plenty to go around. Eat up.Åh
5623:ShinkÅg...all right, thanks.Åh
5624:I completely blew my chance to tell them I couldn't eat any more.
5625:Comet and Kyute look at me in sympathy as I choke down a few more pieces of raw meat.
5626:ShinkÅg...ungh.Åh
5627:I lie face down on the dining hall table, a war waging inside my gut.
5628:I'm feeling a little better as time goes on, but I don't trust myself enough to stand and keep my food down.
5629:KyuteÅgAre you all right? You really shouldn't have done that...Åh
5630:ShinkÅgIt... It's not like I had much of a choice...Åh
5631:KyuteÅgGood grief. I wish they weren't so persistent all the time.Åh
5632:ShinkÅgHaha... Definitely.Åh
5633:They meant well though, which made it hard to brush them aside.
5634:They may have been strangely obstinate about it, but I am a man, after all...
5635:When girls ask you to do something, you want to listen to them as best you can.
5636:MiritaÅgUmmm, I'm sorry. I was just so happy, I kind of got carried away.Åh
5637:ShinkÅgI'm fine, I'm fine. You don't have to worry about it.Åh
5638:ShinkÅgI'm the one who didn't refuse, and I'm responsible for eating too much.Åh
5639:MiritaÅgProfessor...Åh
5640:VeraÅgUh huh. Your self-control is terrible. Mmmnmmn... You've gotta know your own limits.Åh
5641:ShinkÅgTowards the end there, you were the only one left forcing me to eat...Åh
5642:Vera really should restrain herself at least a little.
5643:RinÅgThat's right. You went too far, Vera.Åh
5644:VeraÅgIt's not my fault. Mmmngh... Blame Shink for not being able to eat much!Åh
5645:ShinkÅgYou never do anything wrong, huh...Åh
5646:Well, enough about that. I wonder what the others are up to?
5647:It looked like they were keeping an eye on me on and off the whole time.
5648:VeraÅgOh, by the way... Bibi? You never told me if you wanted to go to the beach, did you?Åh
5649:BibiÅgAh, good timing. We were just talking about that.Åh
5650:VeraÅgOh yeah? Did you want to go too, Shirene?Åh
5651:ShireneÅgIs that a good idea? If we're together, we could fight at any time.Åh
5652:VeraÅgI wouldn't mind, but... really? Do you always feel like fighting me? That could seriously be a pain in the ass...Åh
5653:ShireneÅgI'm not addicted to it that badly. I wasn't planning on interrupting your fun.Åh
5654:VeraÅgOh okay. That's fine then.Åh
5655:ShinkÅgSo Vera found two people to go with her after all?Åh
5656:I was wondering what was going to happen after the mood in here got a little strange, but I guess that's taken care of?
5657:BibiÅgYeah. We finally worked things out together.Åh
5658:ShireneÅgWorked things out? More like you talked me into it. You did convince me though.Åh
5659:ShinkÅgI see...Åh
5660:It sounds like Bibi planted some idea in Shirene's head and got her to go along.
5661:I can easily imagine the honest Shirene being battered down in an argument.
5662:ShinkÅgWell, be safe out there.Åh
5663:BibiÅg...? What are you talking about? You're coming with us, aren't you?Åh
5664:ShinkÅgHuh? No, when did I say that?Åh
5665:VeraÅgWhat? Shink's coming? I don't mind, I guess...Åh
5666:ShinkÅgNo, this is the first I've heard of it. What made you think I'm going with you?Åh
5667:ShireneÅgI was told you were coming though.Åh
5668:ShinkÅgNo, I didn't say a single word about that last night.Åh
5669:ShireneÅgBibi, you lied to me?Åh
5670:BibiÅgIt's your fault for being tricked. It's all good if we get him to agree, right?Åh
5671:Ignoring the scowl on Shirene's face, Bibi smiles and smooths things over with no compunction whatsoever.
5672:It's also pretty clear that she has no intention of taking my desires into account either...
5673:KyuteÅgAh, that reminds me. Mirita, how about visiting my home town with me?Åh
5674:MiritaÅgMmmah? You want me to go home with you?Åh
5675:ShinkÅg...were you still eating?Åh
5676:MiritaÅgMmmmnoo... Ahaha, I didn't have enough earlier...Åh
5677:ShinkÅgReally...Åh
5678:She sure eats a lot more than I expected.
5679:MiritaÅgNever mind that. I'd love to go. It's been forever since I've visited your home, Kyute.Åh
5680:KyuteÅgThat's great to hear. Hey, why don't you come along too, Rin?Åh
5681:RinÅgMmmn... ah? You want me to go with you?Åh
5682:ShinkÅgWere you still pigging out too, Rin?Åh
5683:RinÅgNgh... It's not like that! I'm not a pig, it just tasted too good!Åh
5684:ShinkÅgWell, you don't have to get so defensive...Åh
5685:CometÅgIt's too late to cover up your lack of femininity.Åh
Assuming she's talking to Rin. Comet's "sentences" are so annoying. If she meant that for Shink, I guess she's commenting on his lack of grace.
5686:RinÅgComet, shut up! That's not true!Åh
5687:ShinkÅgIt's okay, I believe you.Åh
5688:They're girls. Obviously accusing one of being a glutton is a sensitive issue.
5689:RinÅgAhem. I'm glad you understand. So Professor Kyute, you wanted me to go home with you?Åh
5690:KyuteÅgThat's right. We have a hot spring there, and the air is nice and crisp. It'd be perfect for your health.Åh
5691:KyuteÅgYou've been doing a lot better lately, but it's still good to take it easy when you can, right?Åh
5692:RinÅgYeah, but... I don't want to be a burden...Åh
5693:KyuteÅgIt's fine. Don't hold back on account of me.Åh
5694:RinÅgO-okay then... Thanks for having me along.Åh
5695:Despite looking confused at Kyute's invitation, Rin nods in assent.
5696:Kyute smiles back at her and pats the dragon girl on the head.
5697:I have to say things have really calmed down in here since earlier.
5698:CometÅgProfessor Kyute, I wish to accompany you as well.Åh
5699:KyuteÅgYou too, Comet? I don't mind, but why?Åh
5700:CometÅgRumor has it your house contains a lot of valuable books. I'd really like to read them.Åh
5701:KyuteÅgAh, I see. That's no problem then. Welcome to the group.Åh
5702:CometÅgGratitude and elation. Yay, yay.Åh
5703:ShinkÅg......Åh
5704:Was that her way of showing excitement? It didn't sound too sincere...
5705:Well, I guess it doesn't matter if they're fine with her.
5706:KyuteÅgOh, would you like to come too, Shink?Åh
5707:RinÅg!?Åh
5708:CometÅgMu!Åh
5709:BibiÅgOooh?Åh
5710:ShireneÅgAh...!Åh
5711:ShinkÅgWhoa, what!?Åh
5712:With one casual phrase, Kyute completely changes the mood in the room.
5713:Rin, Shirene, Bibi, and Comet exchange glances of mutual understanding, form up into two groups, and surround me.
5714:There's no way I can escape from them now. I'm scared...
5715:VeraÅgOooh, Kyute dropped a bomb on everyone.Åh
5716:MiritaÅgD-does anyone else feel like it got stuffy in here all the sudden?Åh
5717:VeraÅgAhaha! Now things are getting good! How about it, Mirita? Should we join in?Åh
5718:MiritaÅgWe'd better not... I don't think we have a chance of winning, and it'd just be a headache.Åh
5719:VeraÅgHmm? Is that the truth?Åh
5720:MiritaÅgWell, I would be happy to go somewhere with him... Wait, what am I saying!Åh
5721:VeraÅgHaha! You said that all on your own, it's not my fault!Åh
5722:ShinkÅgHey you two, instead of joking around, how about helping me out here...Åh
5723:VeraÅgNot happening!Åh
5724:MiritaÅgI don't know...Åh
5725:ShinkÅgI didn't think so.Åh
5726:I wasn't expecting help from them, but I had to try.
5727:Kyute, the instigator of this whole mess, is simply smiling at me for some reason...
5728:I guess I'm on my own.
5729:RinÅgComet... Truce for now?Åh
5730:CometÅgOkay. No objections.Åh
5731:BibiÅgShirene... You understand, right?Åh
5732:ShireneÅgI'm not as crazy as the rest of you, but all right, I'll cooperate.Åh
5733:The two groups stare me down while I consider what to do.
5734:It looks like I have to pick between the group going home with Kyute and the group going to the beach.
5735:RinÅgProfessor Shink! Come to the hot spring with us!Åh
5736:CometÅgHot springs are nice. They're perfect for relaxing and stress relief, just what you need.Åh
5737:ShinkÅgWell... maybe...Åh
5738:BibiÅgWhat are you saying? The ocean is way better for that. What could beat swimming beneath the pure, blue sky?Åh
5739:ShireneÅgI wouldn't know, but Bibi, you can swim?Åh
5740:BibiÅgThat doesn't matter, help me out here. So how about it, professor?Åh
5741:ShinkÅgI don't know...Åh
5742:I told them I didn't feel like going anywhere in the first place, now this...
5743:RinÅgHot spring!Åh
5744:BibiÅgBeach!Åh
5745:CometÅgThe professor is an intellectual so he'd be better off with us.Åh
5746:ShireneÅgThat's not necessarily true. He also keeps his body in good shape.Åh
5747:ShinkÅg......Åh
5748:Now what? Well, I guess this will all be over once I pick...
5749:KyuteÅgHehe, you're quite popular, aren't you? You'd better choose one or the other.Åh
5750:ShinkÅg...sigh.Åh
5751:It doesn't look like Kyute's going to interfere. It's all up to me now...
5752:No point stalling any longer. I'm as ready as I'll ever be.
5753:"Go with the hot spring group."
5754:"Go to the beach."
5755:"Decline both after all."
5756:ShinkÅgThe hot spring sounds most appealing so I'll go with that.Åh
5757:RinÅgWe did it!Åh
5758:CometÅgNice choice.Åh
5759:BibiÅgTch, did I ever have a chance? Sigh, I've lost all motivation.Åh
5760:ShireneÅgI know... Well, whatever, but when you get back, you better practice with me.Åh
5761:ShinkÅgYeah, I'd be glad to.Åh
5762:I honestly thought that was going to go worse, but I'm relieved to see they know when to admit defeat.
5763:KyuteÅgHehehe, looks like that's settled. I'm glad we resolved that without a fight.Åh
5764:ShinkÅgAh, ahaha... Sorry for making a big scene out of it.Åh
5765:Wait a second, this was her fault in the first place...
5766:KyuteÅgHmm, is something wrong?Åh
5767:ShinkÅgNo, nothing at all.Åh
5768:I look Kyute in the eyes, but she dodges with a pretty smile.
5769:No matter how long I stay here, I don't think I'm ever going to win...
5770:KyuteÅgWell I suppose we all need to get ready so shall we wrap things up for today?Åh
5771:RinÅgOkay! Aah, I'm so excited! Together with Professor Shink at a hot spring!Åh
5772:CometÅgDon't get so excited that you collapse from exhaustion. I'd have him all to myself then.Åh
5773:RinÅgMngh, I'm not a child.Åh
5774:CometÅgI wonder.Åh
5775:RinÅgMmmngh! You better make sure you don't collapse from a lack of sleep.Åh
5776:CometÅgDon't worry. I'm fine without sleep.Åh
5777:Rin and Comet leave the dining hall together, a minor quarrel breaking out between the two.
5778:It doesn't look like they're really fighting though. This too is a form of friendship, I guess.
5779:VeraÅgI've got to get ready too. Anyone who's late gets left behind!Åh
5780:BibiÅgYeah yeah. Damn, what a downer.Åh
5781:ShireneÅgHey, wait up! At least tell us when we're supposed to leave!Åh
5782:Following behind Rin and Comet, the beach crew head back to their rooms to get ready for their trip.
5783:Hmm... Now I'm starting to worry about them.
5784:Well, considering how adept Vera is, I shouldn't be concerned.
5785:KyuteÅgSee you later, Shink. We leave in three days so make sure you're ready by then.Åh
5786:ShinkÅgThanks Kyute. I will be.Åh
5787:MiritaÅgI'm out of here too. Thanks for everything today.Åh
5788:ShinkÅgNo problem. See ya.Åh
5789:Mirita thanks me and leaves with Kyute. Waving goodbye to them, I too head out to start packing my bags.
5790:Now then, what's my sudden and unexpected vacation going to turn out like...
5791:ShinkÅgThe beach, I guess.Åh
5792:BibiÅgHah, only natural.Åh
5793:ShireneÅgWhat was so natural about that? It did turn out well though.Åh
5794:RinÅgUnnnngh, you're so mean, Professor Shink.Åh
5795:CometÅgTraitor.Åh
5796:ShinkÅgThat's not going to help your cause...Åh
5797:The sound of visiting a hot spring was appealing, but in the end I was more worried about this group.
5798:But I guess Vera would take control of Bibi? Shirene seems like she's being manipulated into this too...
5799:KyuteÅgOkay Shink. Keep them out of trouble, all right?Åh
5800:ShinkÅgYes ma'am.Åh
5801:Based on the tone of her voice, it sounds like Kyute was worried about them too.
5802:Why didn't she just say that in the first place...
5803:KyuteÅgHehe, that's that. I was looking forward to having you come along though, Shink.Åh
5804:ShinkÅgOh, is that right?Åh
5805:Now I understand what she was plotting.
5806:KyuteÅgCome on Rin, Comet. You can't stay sullen forever. Go pack, okay?Åh
5807:RinÅgFiiine. Sigh... Professor Shink, let's go shopping when you get back, all right?Åh
5808:CometÅgA shrewd move! I really can't let my guard down. Make plans with me too.Åh
5809:ShinkÅgSure, sure. I can at least do that much with you.Åh
5810:RinÅgYou mean it!? It's a promise!Åh
5811:CometÅgI'll tolerate it for now. I have to pack. See ya.Åh
5812:Rin and Comet both flash me delighted smiles as they leave the dining hall.
5813:It makes me very happy as a man to bring them that much joy.
5814:MiritaÅgAh, well I better go get ready myself.Åh
5815:ShinkÅgAll right. See ya.Åh
5816:KyuteÅgI'm leaving too then. Seriously though, look after them.Åh
5817:ShinkÅgHeard you loud and clear. Just stretch your wings out and enjoy the vacation.Åh
"stretching your feathers" is an actual expression in Japanese, "wings" sounds better in English
5818:Mirita, Kyute, and I exchange good-byes as they follow Rin and Comet out.
5819:Kyute is quite the worry-wort, but it's not like I don't understand her concerns.
5820:ShinkÅgNow, all that's left is...Åh
5821:VeraÅgOK! Now that we know who's going, let's get out of here!Åh
5822:ShireneÅgThat's ridiculous. You have to give me time to pack.Åh
5823:BibiÅgI'm ready whenever. I'm not taking anything special.Åh
5824:ShireneÅgYou may not be, but I need to get things ready.Åh
5825:VeraÅgEhh... I want to go right now though.Åh
5826:Not surprising that Vera isn't one to plan ahead.
5827:I feel like I'm going to be worn out before we even leave...
5828:ShinkÅgAnyway, give me a few days to take care of some paperwork.Åh
5829:VeraÅgDang... Well if you say so, I guess we have to wait.Åh
5830:VeraÅgBeing a teacher must be tough. I can tell just from watching Kyute.Åh
5831:BibiÅgOoh, this is rare. Vera is showing consideration for others.Åh
5832:ShireneÅgSeriously. You're never that sympathetic.Åh
5833:VeraÅgYou know how rude that is? Even I can be considerate every now and then. It simply isn't every day.Åh
5834:ShinkÅgI appreciate you breaking from your normal habits then.Åh
5835:Although judging from her speech and behavior, it wasn't intentional. She's going to make me go gray at a young age...
5836:VeraÅgShut up!! Stop blabbering and go get ready! I'll leave you behind if you're late!Åh
5837:ShinkÅgH-hey!Åh
5838:BibiÅgWell then, I'll get ready myself. Not that I have much to do.Åh
5839:With that, Vera and Bibi leave the dining hall.
5840:I yelled after Vera, but she disappeared in an instant as if she either didn't hear or chose to ignore me.
5841:ShinkÅgAt least tell us when we're leaving...Åh
5842:ShireneÅgI know, right? Shink, there's something I want to ask you later, okay?Åh
5843:ShinkÅgOkay...Åh
5844:Surprised, I can't think of anything else to say to Shirene as she leaves the dining hall. With no one else remaining, I stand up to go.
5845:I'm not sure exactly why, but I'm worried about this trip...
5846:ShinkÅgHmm, I think I'll pass after all. Like I said, I don't feel like going anywhere this year.Åh
5847:RinÅgEeeh... Professor Shink, you can't do that now...Åh
5848:CometÅgChicken, chicken. After all that you refuse to take sides? Keh.Åh
5849:BibiÅgHow gutless. I've suddenly lost all interest.Åh
5850:ShireneÅgI wouldn't say that... but maybe a little?Åh
5851:ShinkÅgHey, hey now...Åh
5852:Wow, they aren't pulling their punches. Was my decision that bad?
5853:It's the same thing I've been saying the whole time though.
5854:KyuteÅgSettle down everyone. Come on, you need to go pack.Åh
5855:MiritaÅgAll right. See you later, professor.Åh
5856:VeraÅgAhaha! All four of you got dumped!Åh
5857:RinÅgSigh...Åh
5858:CometÅgMotivation. Gone.Åh
5859:ShireneÅgCome on, Bibi, let's go.Åh
5860:BibiÅgSure... Tch.Åh
5861:ShinkÅg......Åh
5862:Why am I feeling so guilty? I can practically touch the sense of regret hanging in the room...
5863:There's nothing I can do about it now though. Everyone's already gone.
5864:PhamÅgUh oh, This is why I warned you.Åh
5865:ShinkÅgPham?Åh
5866:PhamÅgSigh... It looks like my advice went unheeded. What a pity.Åh
5867:ShinkÅg......Åh
5868:She makes me feel so ashamed for some reason when she gives me that cold stare.
5869:Did I screw up that badly?
5870:PhamÅgOh well, I suppose this was always a possibility. Keep working hard.Åh
5871:ShinkÅgAh, yeah. Of course I will.Åh
5872:PhamÅgThat's good to hear. Well then...Åh
5873:With a regretful look on her face, Pham disappears.
5874:For some reason her disappearance seemed different than usual though. Or am I just over thinking things?
5875:ShinkÅgNo use worrying about that now.Åh
5876:I shrug off the sense that something was out of place and head back to my room.
5877:Time breezes by, and before I know it, my first year as a teacher has come to a close.
5878:Everyone in my class graduated without issues, and a new class of students were promoted to replace them.
5879:I suppose my life will continue like this without change.
5880:With that thought on my mind, I step into a new classroom for a new year.
5881:PhamÅgHi there. Welcome to the standard ending lecture.Åh
5882:PhamÅgWell, it's a bad end though. I can't help but laugh at the choice you made back there.Åh
5883:PhamÅgI even gave you a hint! Or maybe you just wanted to see what would happen?Åh
5884:PhamÅgMy condolences. You don't get anything for reaching this scene.Åh
5885:PhamÅgWere you expecting a different girl? Tooooo bad, this is my job exclusively.Åh
5886:PhamÅgAnyway, please continue the story. Just for you, I'll pretend you never even came here.Åh
5887:PhamÅgBye bye!Åh
5888:KyuteÅgOkay, is everyone ready to go? Got everything you need packed?Åh
5889:RinÅgAll packed and ready!Åh
5890:CometÅgNo problems here. Sooner the better.Åh
5891:MiritaÅgI think... I'm good to go? How about you, professor?Åh
5892:ShinkÅgReady as ever.Åh
5893:Several days later, after seeing the beach group off, the rest of us gather to head out ourselves.
5894:With most of the students gone home over the break, the academy feels deserted. The courtyard isn't nearly as active as usual.
5895:Given that teachers don't get many opportunities for time off, I'm extremely grateful to tag along.
5896:KyuteÅgAll right then, shall we go?Åh
5897:After checking to make sure everyone was prepared, Kyute begins to lead the way.
5898:ShinkÅgThat reminds me, where exactly is your family's home, Kyute?Åh
5899:KyuteÅgOh, it's not far from here at all. It'd be a real pain if my father had built the academy far from where he lived.Åh
5900:ShinkÅgThat makes sense.Åh
5901:That's a rather logical reason to have the academy here.
5902:I thought it was strange to have it out in the middle of nowhere, but now I understand why.
5903:MiritaÅgAhaha, that sounds exactly like Hibiki.Åh
5904:KyuteÅgYeah, well... it's fine. He has his other strengths.Åh
5905:ShinkÅgI see...Åh
5906:I'm not quite sure what Kyute's referring to, but I can tell she loves her father very dearly.
5907:She isn't as open with it as Vera, but I get the feeling she's attracted to her father as well.
5908:RinÅgI'm jealous that you get along so well with your family.Åh
5909:CometÅgMe too. Not like I have a family though.Åh
5910:ShinkÅgOof...Åh
5911:That's a serious topic to bring up out of nowhere. I better change the subject.
5912:ShinkÅgSo anyway... are we taking a horse and carriage there?Åh
5913:KyuteÅgWhat?Åh
5914:ShinkÅgWhat?Åh
5915:MiritaÅgIt isn't really possible to take a carriage there.Åh
5916:ShinkÅgOh, then we're walking?Åh
5917:KyuteÅg...I, I guess we are then.Åh
5918:ShinkÅgWhy do you make it sound like you hadn't even considered how we'd get there?Åh
5919:Considering how absent-minded Kyute can be, it's certainly possible.
5920:KyuteÅgN-no! It's not that I didn't think about it, umm... I thought we'd just... fly.Åh
5921:ShinkÅgYou and Rin are the only ones who can fly though.Åh
5922:And it'd be difficult for Rin to fly a long distance in her condition too.
5923:So that just leaves Kyute as the only one of us who can fly.
5924:KyuteÅgI, I'll carry you...Åh
5925:ShinkÅgComet, Mirita, and me all at the same time?Åh
5926:No matter how we try to arrange this, it isn't going to work.
5927:RinÅgI, I know! I'll carry Professor Shink!Åh
5928:ShinkÅgNo you won't either. If your strength gives out, I'd rather not be in the air.Åh
5929:RinÅgUgh... I understand...Åh
5930:CometÅgWalking seems safe. Avoiding the possibility of being dropped on the way is a big plus.Åh
5931:KyuteÅgAre you saying you can't depend on me?Åh
5932:MiritaÅgAh, ahaha... It might be better not to fly with Kyute...Åh
5933:ShinkÅgIs there something I should know?Åh
5934:MiritaÅgWell... She's kind of a speed demon like her mother...Åh
5935:ShinkÅgThanks for the tip.Åh
5936:That doesn't sound pleasant.
5937:Recklessly flying through the air, huh? That's going to make me hesitate no matter how much she tries to reassure us.
5938:KyuteÅgWait, Mirita? What did you just tell him!?Åh
5939:MiritaÅgEhh!? N-nothing!Åh
5940:RinÅgUgh... I, I'm feeling fine! So how about...Åh
5941:ShinkÅgNo. How about let's just walk?Åh
5942:The place sounds like it's pretty far away though. I can't believe it's all that close if Kyute is suggesting we fly.
5943:Well, that still doesn't mean we need to risk our lives saving time.
5944:CometÅgAgreed. Lead the way.Åh
5945:KyuteÅgSigh, all right. Come along then.Åh
5946:ShinkÅgYes ma'am.Åh
5947:With a sigh, Kyute begins walking off with the rest of us in tow.
5948:I wonder how long this is going to take...
5949:KyuteÅgAnd we're here. Good job everyone.Åh
5950:ShinkÅg...huh?Åh
5951:Startled at Kyute's voice, I take a look around and see an unfamiliar estate.
5952:W-when did we get here...?
5953:ShinkÅg...whaaaat?Åh
5954:RinÅgWhat's wrong, professor? You look lost.Åh
5955:ShinkÅgAh, no... It's just... That was really quick...Åh
5956:MiritaÅgEh? Wait, did you really think we were going to walk?Åh
5957:ShinkÅgHuh...?Åh
5958:CometÅgOoh, nice joke. You have a great sense of humor, professor.Åh
5959:ShinkÅgN-no...Åh
5960:I didn't mean that as a joke though...
5961:Anyway, how did we get here so fast? The last thing I remember is passing beneath the school gates.
5962:KyuteÅgShink, Shink, take a look.Åh
5963:Unable to watch me scratch my head in confusion any longer, Kyute shows me the jewel in her hand.
5964:What's that? Actually, if I remember right...
5965:ShinkÅgA teleport stone?Åh
5966:KyuteÅgYep. It definitely would have taken too long to walk. Did I surprise you?Åh
5967:ShinkÅgWell, yeah kinda...Åh
5968:I wish she would have just told me in advance... I really thought time had flown by without me noticing.
5969:CometÅgYou thought time had flown by? Professor, maybe you should see a doctor... Ah, too late.Åh
5970:ShinkÅgThat's not nice...Åh
5971:RinÅgIt's fine! I'll love you no matter what kind of illness you have!Åh
5972:ShinkÅgCut it out, you're making me sound pitiful.Åh
5973:This is a bit much, even for my students.
5974:MiritaÅgUmm, don't worry about it. That was just one of Kyute's jokes. They're... rarely in good taste.Åh
5975:ShinkÅgI see. Thanks for the support.Åh
5976:Mirita seems like an angel coming to my rescue.
5977:KyuteÅgRarely in good taste? You're so cruel, Mirita...Åh
5978:CometÅgShe's right though. You have bad taste in jokes.Åh
5979:RinÅgAh, ahaha... I'm sorry. I can't defend you here.Åh
5980:KyuteÅgUghh, ughhh... It's fine, just fine. I know I'm a good-for-nothing teacher who can't tell jokes.Åh
5981:ShinkÅg......Åh
5982:Wow, she took that pretty hard...
5983:She'd badly in need of consoling, but I don't know what to say.
5984:GoblinÅgKeke!!Åh
They actually say "bibi" but that's confusing with Bibi. Japanese has hiragana and katakana to distinguish them. Bibi can mean "small" so it might be meant as a reference to their size though.
5985:ShinkÅgWhoa!?Åh
5986:While I was trying to think of what to say, a strange creature sneaked up on us.
5987:What the hell is this weird-looking thing?
5988:KyuteÅgAh, Koni. Thanks for coming out to greet us.Åh
Strange they use è¨ãS like a name, but there are lots of them.
5989:ShinkÅgGood, you're back to normal...Åh
5990:MiritaÅgHi Koni, it's been awhile.Åh
5991:GoblinÅgKeke, keekeke!Åh
5992:ShinkÅg......Åh
5993:He seems to be emphatically exchanging greetings with Kyute and Mirita, but I don't have a clue what he's saying.
5994:Are they able to understand each other somehow?
5995:KyuteÅgOh, that's right. Let me introduce you. This is Rin and Comet. They're both students at the academy.Åh
5996:GoblinÅgKeke! Ke, ke!Åh
5997:RinÅgR-Rin Dorave. Th-thanks for having us over for the next few days.Åh
!FIXME time period may need changing
5998:CometÅgComet Meteo. Nice to meet you.Åh
5999:The two of them introduced themselves as if this were perfectly normal.
6000:No, they hesitated a little at least. This guy is clearly weird. Is she going to introduce me...?
6001:KyuteÅgAnd this is my colleague Shink. He's a superb teacher.Åh
6002:GoblinÅgKe!?Åh
6003:ShinkÅgUh, ummm... I'm Shink Celestite. Nice to... meet you?Åh
6004:GoblinÅgKe, keke!Åh
6005:ShinkÅgWhat is it?Åh
6006:It seems like he got surprised once he took a look at my face. Do I look weird to him?
6007:GoblinÅgKe...Åh
6008:GoblinÅgUh oh, guys! Little Kyute brought a man home with her!!Åh
6009:GoblinsÅgAre you serious!!??Åh
6010:ShinkÅgThey can speak!?Åh
6011:Then why wasn't he speaking earlier!? I didn't understand a thing he said!
6012:KyuteÅgK-Koni!? Don't shout that so loudly! S-s-s-stop thaaaaat!Åh
6013:Ignoring my own surprise, Kyute chases after the little goblin as he runs into the house.
6014:I stare after her in shock. The other three girls don't seem to be following what's going on either...
6015:MiritaÅgAah... I guess we should go on up too.Åh
6016:RinÅgIs that all right? Maybe we better wait...Åh
6017:CometÅgI'm tired of standing. Lead the way.Åh
6018:MiritaÅgAhaha, sure. It's this way.Åh
6019:With a strained smile, Mirita heads into the residence with Comet acting like she's making herself at home.
6020:Now it's just Rin and I out here...
6021:RinÅg...should we join them?Åh
6022:ShinkÅgWell, otherwise we're just standing here looking like idiots. So we might as well?Åh
6023:Honestly, I'm not in the mood for any more thinking today.
6024:I assume someone will say something to us if we aren't supposed to go in here.
6025:ShinkÅgLet's go then.Åh
6026:RinÅgAh, wait up, Professor Shink!Åh
6027:I give Rin a second to catch up before the two of us enter the large mansion.
6028:Now... What's going to happen next...
6029:KyuteÅgHuh? No one's here? Not my father or mother or even Arane or Suik?Åh
!Characters from Spider and Bird who don't appear in SMMG (I don't think)
6030:GoblinÅgKeke!Åh
6031:KyuteÅgSigh. What bad timing for them to leave.Åh
6032:ShinkÅg......Åh
6033:Having calmed down from the commotion earlier, Kyute sips tea and catches up on news with the goblins.
6034:They're back to saying nothing but "ke" so I have no clue what they're talking about, but Kyute seems to understand.
6035:Very strange indeed. I wish they'd just speak normally... Wonder why they don't...
6036:MiritaÅgAaah, they're not here? I was looking forward to seeing everyone again after so long.Åh
6037:ShinkÅgYou're well acquainted with Kyute's parents and their friends?Åh
6038:MiritaÅgYeah. I know the Arachne Princess Arane and Kyute's mom, Rupiua.Åh
6039:MiritaÅgThen there's the owner of this estate, the one-eyed demon Suik. They're all wonderful people.Åh
6040:ShinkÅgI would have liked to meet them. It's a shame they aren't here.Åh
6041:ShinkÅgShould we be here without the owner's permission though?Åh
6042:KyuteÅgAh, don't worry about that. I'm here, and the goblins said it was all right too.Åh
6043:ShinkÅgThat's a relief then.Åh
6044:I was worried that Kyute might get in trouble later on, but it seems that was a baseless fear.
6045:I guess we should accept the invitation, kick back, and relax then.
6046:RinÅgWow, so this is where Professor Kyute was raised. It's a beautiful place.Åh
6047:CometÅgBeing surrounded by nature is as satisfying as I've been told. Now I just need to find the books.Åh
6048:KyuteÅgYou'll have plenty of time to read later. For now, let's eat. You're all hungry, aren't you?Åh
6049:ShinkÅgAah, yeah now that you mention it, it is about time for lunch.Åh
6050:We left the academy a little before noon, and I am starting to get hungry.
6051:MiritaÅgAh, I'll go prepare lunch then.Åh
6052:GoblinÅgKeke!Åh
6053:KyuteÅgI know, I know. I'll handle it.Åh
6054:MiritaÅgEeeh!? W-why!?Åh
6055:KyuteÅgMirita, you know your cooking is limited to basic things.Åh
!This sounds really rude in Japanese. Literally "your cooking is nothing but crude/roughness"
6056:ShinkÅgReally?Åh
6057:Now that she mentions it, Mirita did eat the boar raw...
6058:Was that simply because she isn't any good at cooking?
6059:MiritaÅgI, I can't say that's not true, but... I've been practicing, and...Åh
6060:KyuteÅgNo way. You're not good enough to cook for others yet.Åh
Damn, ouch.
6061:MiritaÅgUgh... I even took lessons from Vera...Åh
6062:ShinkÅgFrom Vera?Åh
6063:She can cook, too?
6064:I can't picture that at all.
6065:CometÅgVera's cooking is reputed to be better than some three-star restaurants. It's even rumored that she made another chef so depressed he quit his job.Åh
6066:RinÅgHer cooking is definitely good. The presentation is beautiful too.Åh
6067:ShinkÅgAre you serious...Åh
6068:She really can do it all. Once again I underestimated her...
!FIXME â¸ÇﬂÇƒâªÇØï®èLÇ¢ìz ??
6069:KyuteÅgSo anyway, I'll make lunch. Koni, would you like to help?Åh
6070:GoblinÅgKeke!Åh
6071:ShinkÅg...Koni can cook too?Åh
6072:Nothing should surprise me any longer with these strange creatures. They may even match Vera's level of wonder.
!Bleh?
6073:RinÅgAh, I'll help too! I would love for Professor Shink to eat my home cooking!Åh
6074:ShinkÅgMe...?Åh
6075:KyuteÅgUmmm, I don't like the idea of making a guest prepare meals...Åh
6076:RinÅgI don't mind! Cooking is my specialty, you know?Åh
6077:KyuteÅgThat's not the issue... Oh well, you aren't going to take no for an answer.Åh
6078:CometÅgRin is surprisingly stubborn. Once she proposes something, she won't listen to anyone else.Åh
6079:RinÅgMmmn, that isn't true...Åh
6080:CometÅgYou're the only one who thinks so.Åh
6081:ShinkÅgAll right girls, no fighting.Åh
6082:I hurry to put a stop to their argument before it turns ugly.
6083:We came here on vacation, and I'd rather not see that ruined by bickering.
6084:KyuteÅgListen to Shink. Okay Rin, you really want to help?Åh
6085:RinÅgYes! You can count on me!Åh
6086:Giving up on a losing battle, Kyute asks Rin for help with a wry smile on her face.
6087:Kyute heads out of the room with Rin smiling ear-to-ear behind her, leaving only Comet and Mirita here with me.
6088:ShinkÅgYou're not going to pitch in, Comet?Åh
6089:CometÅgStupid question. I'd never do something like that.Åh
6090:ShinkÅgNever say never...Åh
6091:CometÅgOh! Professor, are you trying to get some alone time with Mirita!?Åh
6092:MiritaÅgUeeee!? That would be a bit awkward...Åh
6093:ShinkÅgNo. Although you don't have to freak out so badly about the idea...Åh
6094:I didn't expect her to say she loved the idea, but it's a little sad to hear her so flatly refuse it.
6095:CometÅgHu, rejected. So sad.Åh
6096:ShinkÅg...you think you have permission to screw with me here?Åh
!He didn't sound that mad in Japanese, but the conversation indicates he is.
6097:MiritaÅgP-professor! Calm down! Come on, deep breaths, deep breaths!Åh
6098:ShinkÅgNgh...Åh
6099:I felt the veins popping out of my forehead as soon as Comet ridiculed me with that self-satisfied grin of hers. Mirita had to hold me back until I returned to normal.
6100:That wasn't good. Why did I get so mad at a student's childish insult?
6101:CometÅgOoh, how rational of you. I wish you had hurled verbal abuse down on me though.Åh
6102:ShinkÅg...are you a masochist?Åh
6103:CometÅgOh yes. Insult me more...Åh
6104:ShinkÅg......Åh
6105:I don't like where this is headed. Wait, maybe she really is a masochist?
6106:CometÅgAbandonment play now? I'm getting wet.Åh
6107:ShinkÅgPerhaps you're the one who needs to see a doctor?Åh
6108:CometÅgKidding. Just a joke. That was fun, wasn't it?Åh
6109:ShinkÅgNo, I'm actually kind of worried for you.Åh
6110:CometÅgThat's love.Åh
6111:ShinkÅgNo, it definitely isn't.Åh
6112:...this conversation keeps getting weirder.
6113:MiritaÅgAhaha, you two get along so well.Åh
6114:CometÅgOf course. We're husband and wife, after all.Åh
6115:ShinkÅgTeacher and student.Åh
6116:CometÅgTch.Åh
6117:Whoa...
6118:RinÅgProfessor Shink gets along with me better than anyone!Åh
6119:ShinkÅg...why are you listening in?Åh
6120:CometÅgRin is a scary girl!Åh
6121:MiritaÅgAha, haa... This is getting old...Åh
!Translating gdgd is no fun.
6122:Yeah, this really has gotten out of hand.
6123:Although having nonsense conversations like these can be fun once in awhile too.
6124:CometÅgProfessor, you're weird.Åh
6125:ShinkÅgRight back at ya.Åh
Bleh? Not something Shink would say?
6126:We continue killing time until the food is brought out, bantering back and forth in silly dialogue.
6127:ShinkÅgWow, this is delicious!Åh
6128:The instant I put the first bite into my mouth, I can't help but comment on how good it is.
6129:The dishes lined up in front of me are all so delicious that my hand moves on its own, grabbing food left and right.
6130:MiritaÅgUgh, why can't I cook like this...Åh
6131:KyuteÅgDon't worry. If you keep practicing, you'll be able to cook one day.Åh
6132:CometÅgBut I don't know about learning from Vera. Maybe you aren't understanding her, Mirita.Åh
!I doubt the wisdom of learning from Vera, etc.
6133:ShinkÅgHmm? What do you mean by that?Åh
6134:CometÅgVera sucks at teaching.Åh
!is poor at, "sucks" sounds Comet-ish
6135:ShinkÅgOh...? Is that so?Åh
6136:That's certainly a surprise. Just when I was thinking Vera didn't have any chinks in her armor...
!Maybe not the best phrase
6137:RinÅgSince Vera is capable of anything, she starts from the assumption that everyone else is too...Åh
6138:RinÅgI asked her about something I didn't understand while studying once, and her explanation was gobbledygook.Åh
6139:ShinkÅgWow...Åh
6140:That makes sense. Since she understands everything so easily, she can't relate when others get stuck.
6141:KyuteÅgIf you understand at least a little to start with, that can be an excellent way of teaching though.Åh
!FIXME? This might be the most confusing line I've seen. Is Kyute backing up Vera and exposing that she sucks as a teacher too (which we've kinda seen)? Am I completely misreading the line? Maybe ê¶Ç¢ is being used for "terrible"? That would fit with Shink's next line in a Ç∆Ç§Ç±Ç∆ÇÕÅBÅBÅBÇ∆Ç¢Ç§Ç±Ç∆ formation. The fact that it's a terrible method of teaching means she's a terrible person to ask. Kyute really sounds like she's disagreeing with Rin though, and Shink is shrugging off Kyute in the next line. Fuck me.
6142:ShinkÅgWell anyway, it sounds like she's a terrible person to ask for help.Åh
6143:MiritaÅgUgh... You need to teach me then, Kyute.Åh
6144:KyuteÅgBegging doesn't change the fact that I'm busy.Åh
6145:MiritaÅgI know... Who can I find to learn from though...Åh
6146:RinÅgAh, how about me? I have time, and it'd give me an opportunity to polish my skills too.Åh
6147:MiritaÅgEh... Really?Åh
6148:RinÅgYep, as long as you're fine with it.Åh
6149:MiritaÅgIf you really don't mind then...Åh
6150:ShinkÅgMmngh, uh huh... Take advantage of your youth.Åh
!Talking with his mouth full
6151:Friends teaching one another can help both mutually improve themselves.
6152:Being able to see the real thrill of student life unfold in front of me makes me glad I became a teacher.
6153:CometÅgFor some reason I feel like I'm being left out.Åh
6154:ShinkÅgYou shouldn't hesitate to join in then.Åh
6155:CometÅgNot interested. My interest lies in knowledge, not practical experience. Except for that.Åh
6156:ShinkÅgThat...?Åh
6157:CometÅgYes, that. It's a secret... Kuku...Åh
6158:ShinkÅg......brrÅh
6159:Why did I get a sudden chill up my spine?
6160:Does her secret activity have something to do with me, I wonder?
!You can't be this dumb Shink.
6161:KyuteÅgAll right now. I'm glad you're excited, but don't stop eating. If you don't clean your plates...Åh
6162:RinÅgY-yes! Of course!Åh
6163:MiritaÅgThere will be hell to pay if we have any left over...Åh
This seems a little extreme.
6164:ShinkÅgI was intending to eat it all in the first place.Åh
6165:At Kyute's signal, everyone begins to fully concentrate on their meals.
6166:Everything really is delicious...
6167:ShinkÅgWhew, I'm stuffed.Åh
6168:After lunch, I rub my stomach in satisfaction and relax with some tea.
6169:ShinkÅgAah, there's nothing better than tea after a meal.Åh
6170:CometÅgThat's a sign you're old.Åh
6171:ShinkÅgGah...Åh
6172:RinÅgComet, that's rude!Åh
6173:CometÅgIt's the truth. I didn't say anything incorrect.Åh
6174:RinÅgWell, even so, you shouldn't...Åh
6175:ShinkÅgUnf!Åh
6176:Even so? Rin's agreeing with her?
6177:Am I really that much of an old man?
6178:KyuteÅgThat's not true at all. Tea is delicious, and I love it too.Åh
6179:MiritaÅgAh, me too. We used to drink it all the time at home.Åh
6180:ShinkÅgSee!?Åh
6181:The unexpected support breathes new life into me.
6182:They know what I'm talking about. Tea is awesome, and drinking it doesn't make me an old man.
6183:CometÅgWell, whatever. Not like it matters.Åh
6184:RinÅgC-Comet... But you're the one that brought it up in the first place...Åh
6185:CometÅgDoesn't matter. What does matter are the books I still want to read.Åh
6186:KyuteÅgAah, your reason for coming. Follow me then, I'll show you where they are.Åh
6187:CometÅgThank you, thank you. Huhu, I can't wait to see what books are here.Åh
6188:RinÅgAh, hold up! Comet! Ugh, she left me...Åh
6189:With great anticipation on her face, Comet jumps up and skips out of the room behind Kyute.
6190:Rin calls after her to wait, but Comet doesn't even turn around, as though Rin's voice didn't even reach her.
6191:ShinkÅgHmm, well when it comes to books, she gets a gleam in her eye...Åh
6192:MiritaÅgAhaha, she definitely loves to read.Åh
6193:RinÅgShe has barely left the library at all since summer break started. I love books too, but...Åh
6194:ShinkÅgSo, what should we do? We can split up here and go do whatever we want, if that's fine with you two.Åh
6195:MiritaÅgThat sounds good to me. The goblins will let us know if we try to go somewhere we shouldn't.Åh
6196:RinÅgI'm going to the hot spring then...Åh
6197:MiritaÅgI think I'll go have a chat with Kyute.Åh
6198:ShinkÅgAll right, meet back here for dinner then?Åh
6199:RinÅgOkay!Åh
6200:MiritaÅgAll right.Åh
6201:The two girls nod their heads and leave the room. I down the rest of my tea while staring at the beautiful scenery outside.
6202:Hmm, now what should I do...
6203:"Take a dip in the hot spring."
6204:"Go check out the books."
6205:"Talk to Kyute and Mirita."
6206:ShinkÅgThose hot springs do sound appealing.Åh
6207:I'd like to take a dip if possible, but Rin did just say she was going in.
6208:It'd be bad if we crossed paths... Perhaps I should hold off for awhile until I'm sure she's done.
6209:RinÅgAh, Professor Shink, Professor Shink!Åh
6210:ShinkÅgHuh? You didn't go to the hot spring?Åh
6211:RinÅgAhaha, yeah... I remembered something I had to do...Åh
6212:ShinkÅgSomething you had to do?Åh
6213:What could that be? I didn't think she had anything special planned...
6214:ShinkÅgHmm, you weren't doing homework were you?Åh
6215:RinÅgAhaha, as if. That can wait until we get back.Åh
6216:ShinkÅgRight, of course.Åh
6217:She certainly wouldn't want to do homework considering she came here for rest and relaxation.
6218:RinÅgAnyway, umm... Professor Shink, did you have any plans for the rest of the afternoon?Åh
6219:ShinkÅgMe? Not really. I was thinking about taking a dip in the hot spring after you were finished.Åh
6220:RinÅgAh, perfect timing then!Åh
6221:ShinkÅgPerfect timing...?Åh
6222:RinÅgYeah! Let's go in together!Åh
6223:ShinkÅgAaack!Åh
6224:I was already confused trying to figure out what she was doing, but that sudden bombshell sent me into a coughing fit.
6225:What is this girl trying to pull...
6226:RinÅgHuh? Was that a yes?Åh
6227:ShinkÅgOf course it wasn't a yes! Why in the world would I get into a hot spring with you!Åh
6228:RinÅgEh...? Because I want to bathe with you...Åh
6229:ShinkÅgLook here, I'm a man. You're a woman. Are you following me so far?Åh
6230:RinÅg...? Of course, and...?Åh
6231:ShinkÅgAnd what? That's it!Åh
6232:RinÅg...is there a problem somewhere?Åh
6233:ShinkÅg.........Åh
6234:Does she really not understand?
6235:ShinkÅgYes, loads and loads of problems!Åh
6236:RinÅgLike what?Åh
6237:ShinkÅgLike what...? It'd be embarrassing, and... and lots of other things!Åh
6238:RinÅgIt, it might be a little embarrassing, but I don't mind. I'd be in there with you, after all...Åh
6239:RinÅgI'd get mad if you snuck a peek without permission, but what's the problem if I tell you it's okay?Åh
6240:RinÅgAh! Of course, I'm fine with you taking a peek any time you want though!Åh
6241:ShinkÅgI'm not going to do that! That'd just make me a pervert!Åh
6242:This isn't working. For some reason we aren't seeing eye to eye on this.
6243:Is this simply another difference between the social etiquette of monsters and humans?
6244:Maybe, but I think because of her age, she's kind of shy...
!Bleh. I don't even know whose shyness this is referring to.
6245:RinÅgThen... you won't?Åh
6246:ShinkÅgUgh...Åh
6247:Rin looks at me with upturned, pleading eyes. I almost give in and nod in acceptance.
6248:ShinkÅgNo, no no! It's not acceptable for men and women to bathe together!Åh
6249:RinÅgEh? Human men and women never do that?Åh
6250:ShinkÅgLovers and married couples sure, but not otherwise.Åh
6251:RinÅgI see... Well, that's too bad then.Åh
6252:ShinkÅgSigh...Åh
6253:My frantic arguments prevail. Rin slumps her shoulders and reluctantly gives up.
6254:If this were any of her classmates, they'd probably drag me into the water. I got lucky it was Rin.
6255:RinÅgAww, I had really been looking forward to this too...Åh
6256:ShinkÅgWell in the future, you can ask your lover or husband.Åh
6257:RinÅgSigh, if you say so.Åh
6258:ShinkÅgGlad that's settled. I'm not bathing with you.Åh
6259:RinÅgOookay. I don't want to bother you so I'll make do.Åh
6260:ShinkÅgThat's a good girl.Åh
6261:Rin looks down at the ground and I hear a touch of sourness in her voice.
6262:I reach out my hand and rub her head, and just from that, she blushes and smiles.
6263:She really is a shrewd and manipulative girl.
6264:RinÅgAhhh...Then Mr Shink you should go ahead first.Åh
6265:ShinkÅgOh...? Is it OK by you?Åh
6266:RinÅgYes.You must be tired and I take a long time when bathing...Åh
6267:ShinkÅgI see.Åh
6268:It's true that girls to take a long bath. 
6269:I guess I should just take her offer. 
6270:ShinkÅgOkay, I'll go in first.Åh
6271:RinÅgSure. Please enjoy yourself.Åh
6272:ShinkÅgI will.Åh
6273:I replied to Rin with a big smile as I leave the room and head for the hot spring.
6274:Well, let's enjoy the hot spring, shall we?
6275:ShinkÅgHaha...This is paradise!Åh
6276:After washing my head and body, I was soaking in the bathtub and stretching myself.
6277:This is good...how wonderful.
6278:ShinkÅgYeah. That's about all I can think of.Åh
6279:The temperature is nice and it is really soothing.
6280:I am sorry Rin, but let me enjoy a little more...
6281:RinÅgLalalaÅh
6282:ShinkÅg...What!?Åh
6283:I was thinking about the hot spring, so I was surprised that I heard someone humming.
6284:Could it be...?
6285:RinÅgI wonder if Mr Shink is still here? I thought I could use you are already done after this much time as an excuse...Åh
6286:ShinkÅg......Åh
6287:Of course that excuse does not work!
6288:What is she thinking about...! No, that's not the problem, I have to do something!
6289:ShinkÅgI have nowhere to hideÅIÅh
6290:Maybe if I head to entrance now... No that will not work, think how hard she tries to drag you in... I can already see the future of myself being dragged in...
6291:Then what should I do...
6292:ShinkÅg... Oh, this is it!Åh
6293:Feeling that I had no more time to waste, I put a nearby bucket over my head and submerged my body into the hot water up to my shoulders.
6294:She won't find me like this...
6295:ShinkÅgOf course this won't work! What am I doing...!Åh
6296:I immediately realize my stupid mistake, but I don't think I can do anything about it now.
6297:I guess I have to honestly apologize then...
6298:RinÅgHmmm...What? He's not here....?Åh
6299:ShinkÅg.........Åh
6300:RinÅg...Oh. He really finished and left... How disappointing...Åh
6301:ShinkÅg...WhatÅHÅh
6302:Maybe she really did not notice me...?!
6303:No, that can't be the case...
6304:RinÅgGuess I will just take bath myself. I guess male human really takes bath quickly...Åh
6305:ShinkÅg......Åh
6306:Could it be? She really did not notice me!?
6307:Lucky for me... Fortunately, the bucket is in the way so Rin does not see me.
6308:If I can just hold out long enough until she leaves...ÅI
6309:RinÅgWell, it's too bad that he is not here... but I still have chance. I think now it is the time for me to enjoy the hot spring by myself.Åh
6310:ShinkÅgNo you do not have any chance...Åh
6311:RinÅgLet's see, wash the body and head first... Toweels don't soak in the bathtub, was it?Åh
6312:ShinkÅg.........Åh
6313:If she is so cautious, I think she should not try to bath with another man.
6314:I continued to quietly hide my breath as I listened to Rin humming as she washed herself.
6315:RinÅgWa...The water is nice...Åh
6316:ShinkÅg......Åh
6317:Finally, Rin finishes washing her body and begins to soak in the hot water.
6318:It's been a really long time, but Rin doesn't seem to notice. It would best if it all goes without any happenings.   
6319:RinÅgI guess it was a good thing that Mr Shink was not here... I guess I forgot about my bodyÅh
6320:RinÅgI guess... If that is going to happen... Heheh, I will not be sure what to do...Åh
6321:ShinkÅg......Åh
6322:What is Rin talking about?
6323:She seems to be troubled... about what is going to happen...?
6324:RinÅgHuh. Really nice hot water... and the temperature is getting to my liking...  hmmm, how high should I bring it up?Åh
6325:ShinkÅg......Åh
6326:Getting to my liking?
6327:What is going on...Surely it is not possible to raise temperaure so easily...?
6328:ShinkÅg......Åh
6329:Wait... The temperature seems to be rising steadily...
6330:I mean, the water starts to sound like it is being boiled!?
6331:RinÅgAh, it is best for the temperature to be hot like this...Åh
6332:RinÅgIn the school bathroom, no one likes this much heat, so I always have to go alone last...Åh
6333:RinÅgI know my body temperature rises when I am warm is a species trait... I wish I could control it...Åh
6334:ShinkÅg............Åh
6335:That is what she meantÅI This is bad!
6336:How hot is she going to raise the temperature!?
6337:RinÅgAh, it is good... Now it's time to raise it all at once...Åh
6338:The temperature of the hot water is raising quickly the moment I heard Rin muttering like that.
6339:The water is bobbing, and I could feel the stinging heat on my skin...
6340:ShinkÅgAh, it's too hot!!!Åh
6341:RinÅgOh my God!? It's...it's you Mr Shink!?Åh
6342:ShinkÅgI can't! I can't take it anymore!!Åh
6343:I jumped out of the bathtub as the water is way too hot, ignoring Rin who looking at me shockingly.
6344:This is not the tempearature that a human can tolerateÅI
6345:RinÅgWhere, where were you!?Å@Rather, were you diving underwater all this thime!?Åh
6346:ShinkÅgNo, I wasn't diving...!?Åh
6347:I turned and try to explain to Rin who is surprised, but suddenly my eyes are feeling dazed.
6348:Oh... It must be because I got up too fast... I am not feeling well...
6349:ShinkÅgI am sorry...Rin...Åh
6350:RinÅgWhat...?Åh
6351:RinÅgWait, what!! Shink!? Mr Shink~~!Åh
6352:I slowly lost consciousness as I watched Rin jumped out of the hot water to try to support me.
6353:ShinkÅgAh...ÅIÅh
6354:RinÅgOh, thank God... Are you alright...?Åh
6355:ShinkÅgYeah...Åh
6356:Now I came back to my senses, I rememebered what happened as I see Rin who looks at me with concern. 
6357:It seems that I have lost consciousness...
6358:ShinkÅgSorry... How long did I pass outÅHÅh
6359:RinÅgAbout a few minutes. Are you feeling alright now?Åh
6360:ShinkÅgYeah...Åh
6361:With that being said, I checked my body and nothing was wrong in particular. 
6362:Now I have clear consciousness as well, so I guess the comma was only temporary. 
6363:Now the wind is blowing to my body, it feels somewhat nice...
6364:ShinkÅgWait, I am naked!?Å@Rin you are too!?Åh
6365:RinÅgIt's fine. I made sure not to let the water get cold.Åh
6366:ShinkÅgNo, that is not what I meant...!Åh
6367:At least cover yourself with a towel... Wait, does this mean I am been seen as well...!?
6368:RinÅgSo, Mr Shink... Are you sure you are okay? Can you move?Åh
6369:ShinkÅgYes I am fine so please cover yourself! Where, where is the towel!?Åh
6370:RinÅgHuh... If you can scream that much, I guess you are really fine... That's good... Ahh...Åh
6371:ShinkÅg......?Åh
6372:As I was trying to find a towel, while I was getting impatient not being able to find it, I could still hear something off in Rin's voice. 
6373:I am thankful for Rin to be concerning about me, but something seems wrong...
6374:She is staring at me with her cheeks red and ... and her sight is focusing on one spot...
6375:ShinkÅgWhere are you looking at...!?Åh
6376:RinÅgOh... I am glad that you are okay... You know now I am relived I am feeling kind of horny...Åh
6377:ShinkÅgW, wait...! What are you talking about...!Åh
6378:RinÅgYou just collapsed out of sudden... I was worried about you and got worked up... Now you are fine so I ...Åh
6379:Apparently, the heightened spirits had stimulated her instincts.
6380:Wait, why am I trying to analyze this calmly... I must run away...!
6381:ShinkÅgI... I cannot move!?Åh
6382:RinÅgHuhu... You cannot run away Mr Shink... This is your punishment for making me worried...Åh
6383:ShinkÅgWait, calm down!!Åh
6384:RinÅgI can't wait... Hmm... I can't hold it anymore...!Åh
6385:My desperate resistance is in vain and Rin moves her face towards my body.
6386:My strength was not enough to eascape from her. I was at the mercy of Rin's power...
6387:ShinkÅg......Ç¡ÅAÉäÉì......Ç‚ÇﬂÇ¡......ÅIÅh
6388:RinÅgDon't try to run... I will make you to feel good now...Åh
6389:RinÅgSee, this is how... Using tip of my tail... to stroke your dick...Åh
6390:ShinkÅg......!Åh
6391:The sudden stimulation made my body jumped up. 
6392:My penis is trembling and shaking, indicating that it is excited by this situation. 
6393:RinÅgSee he is happy... I will continue and slide my tail... Ahh...Åh
6394:RinÅgLast time the semen I had was very delicious... So this time I want to tasste it directly...Åh
6395:While she is gazing at my penis intensely, she slides the tail of the tail and... it  tightens on my dick. 
6396:As she opens her mouth, Rin strethces out her tongue and let it touches the tip of the dick.
6397:ShinkÅg......ÅIÅh
6398:RinÅgMmm, mmm, ... Oh, oh... Mmm, it's a little embrassing... mmm...Åh
6399:RinÅgBut... It tastes like... Mr Shink... Ah...!Åh
6400:ShinkÅg...Rin...That is...!Åh
6401:As the rougue tongue touches the glans, I felt an electric current runs throught my body.
6402:As to check my reaction, Rin changes the position of the licking. Each time she does so, it gives new stimulation to the glans. 
6403:RinÅgHmm, mmm, mmm, ... How is it...? Does it feel good, Mr Shink...?Åh
6404:ShinkÅgThat is...Åh
6405:RinÅgIf you feel good, please don't hesitate to say... mmm...Åh
6406:RinÅgIt seems the... semen becomes more delicious if you feel better... Mmm...Åh
6407:ShinkÅgUgh, Rin... Hah, no more...!Åh
6408:Rin licks the glans diligently while softly tightening the end of the dick with her tail. 
6409: The combined stimulation of jerking and bounching of my dick are an excellent stimulation and provides plenty of pleasure.
6410:RinÅgChu, chu...Mmm, gradually... I could taste it now... Mmm...Åh
6411:RinÅgShink's delicous semen... And belongs only to me... my own...Åh
6412:RinÅgMore... I will make you feel better... Please give me lots of cum... Huhu...Åh
6413:ShinkÅgAh, Rin... That is...Åh
6414:Licking off the runners, Rin slowly opens her mouth and begins to suck on the glistening glans.
6415:RinÅgAmmu, jizz... Mmmm, ssshhhh...!Åh
6416:ShinkÅgWa...!?Åh
6417:As the licking made the glans became sensitive, her sucking made me wiggle my hips.
6418:Rin saw my reaciton, she increased the strength of the sucking and increase my feeling of ejaculation.
6419:RinÅgOh, oh...! It is delicious...! Mr Shink's dick is very ... delicious...!Åh
6420:RinÅgHere you go... Nnnnnn, I am going to suck you off slowly... Mmm... Juppu...Åh
6421:ShinkÅgAh, that place is... If you suck that much...!Åh
6422:RinÅgNnnnnn... That's a good reaction Mr Shink... I am happy as well...Mmmm...!Åh
6423:While sucking, her tongue crawls inside my mouth made it feel like stroking. I am experiencing sucking and stroking as 2 kinds of stimulations. 
6424:I am trying my best to endure this situation but I feel like I could cum at any moment. 
6425:RinÅgMmmm, ssshhhh, ssshhhh... I guess, the stimulation... is not enough... Slurp...Åh
6426:RinÅgThen I shall go deeper... Mmm, and suck harder...Now, how about this...?Åh
6427:RinÅgMmmm, mmm...Juppu, slurp...ÅIÅh
6428:ShinkÅgAh, ahh...!Åh
6429:RinÅgJuppu, mmmm... It's coming out... Mr Shink's delicious semen...Nnngg, sshhhh, psshh...!Åh
6430:RinÅgMore...make more... cum more for me...!Åh
6431:Apart from the stimulation she is already giving me, the sight of Rin entranced in devouring my dick arouses me intensely.
6432:Perhaps it is because I don't see her like this, but just the sight of seeing this alone make my brain transmit pleasure.
6433:RinÅgNnngg, mmm... Zuu, zururu... It is not out yet... Nnnnghhh, nnnnggg...Åh
6434:RinÅgDespite your dick is shaking ... Nnnnghhh, nnnnggg... Maybe I need to...stimulate more...?Åh
6435:RinÅgNnnnghhh, nnnnggg... Then... how about ... this kind of stimulation...?Åh
6436:Thinking just sucking alone would not lead to ejaculation, Rin takes her face away from the dick and wraps her tail up and down which had been wrapped around the end of the dick. 
6437:The sensation of hard scales wrapping around the dick and being rubbed up and down is causing a stimulation similar to pain.
6438:ShinkÅgThis is...Åh
6439:RinÅgMmm, huh... Here, like this... I am wrapping my tail with your penis, and you will be able to cum...ahh...Åh
6440:RinÅgIt will twitch and try to push back my tail... Hmm... How does it fell? Does it feel good?Åh
6441:ShinkÅgAh, that is...Åh
6442:Perhaps because of Rin's high body temperature, her tail seems a little bit hot, is transmitting the heat to my dick, causing a rush of active semen rushes up from the testicles. 
6443:Rin must have felt that too. With a gengle smile on her face, she was slowly working on my dick up and down.
6444:ShinkÅgAhh... Being wrapped by the scales... It's getting hot...Ahh!Åh
6445:RinÅgMmm, it's fine... Hmm, it is not that hot.... See, it seems to be just the right amount of stimulation...Åh
6446:RinÅgBesides, your dick seems to be happy about my tail wrapping around it...?Åh
6447:ShinkÅgAh, that is...Åh
6448:Every time the tail rubs against my dick, my dick jumps up in an interesting way, my head is filled with a pleasure that makes my head go blank.
6449:WIth the kind of sensation that could never be achieved by a human partner, my excitemnt is heightned to its highest level.
6450:RinÅgOh... I am opening my mouth... like this and waiting for you...Nnnnghhh, nnnnggg...Åh
6451:RinÅgPlease try to aim here... Nnnnghhh, nnnnggg...Åh
6452:ShinkÅgOh, ugh... If you stimulate it like that...Ahh...!Åh
6453:The dick is wrapped by her tail, the glans is licked by the tongue and the stimulation is transmitted to the dick simutaneously, my body trembles helplessly.
6454:Meanwhile, the dick is being rubbed mercilessly up and down, the semen pooling stored at the back finally exceeds the limit of its endurance.
6455:ShinkÅgRin...Ahh, I am...!Åh
6456:RinÅgYes... Oh, please let it out...!Å@Pleaes put it in my mouth... Mmmm, please put Mr Shink's juice into my mouth...!Åh
6457:ShinkÅgAggghhh!!Åh
6458:Sensing the trembling of the meat stick, she is rubbing it with the weak part of the scales precisely.
6459:Unable to stand the stimulation, I spurted out my accumulated semen with great force.
6460:RinÅgMmmm, mmmm... It's coming in, Mr Shink's semen... Nnnngggghhhh, it's coming in my mouth, ooohhh...!Åh
6461:RinÅgPlease give me more... Mmm, nnnghh, nnnggg...Åh
6462:ShinkÅgUgh, hah... Oh...Åh
6463:A large amount of semen spattered on the floor. I was again around by the sight of Rin drinking it deliciously. 
6464:Totally different from her usual appearance, the semen-covered Rinlooks bewitching in my eyes.
6465:My dick regained its strength at the sight of Rin, and starts to twitch again and again, as if it is begging for more stimulation.
6466:RinÅgMmmm, kkk... Mmm, it seems that Mr Shink's dick... is not satisfied yet...Åh
6467:ShinkÅg...That is...Åh
6468:RinÅgHmmm, then... Hmm, now I'm going to drink directly from it... Okay?Åh
6469:ShinkÅg...What are you...Åh
6470:Rin smiles innocectly and shifts the ttail that was wrapping the dick, exposing stick again.
6471:The dick lost the heat which was enveloping it, as it contacts with cold air it is twitching again and again.
6472:RinÅgMmm, hah... How cute, hmmm...... He can't wait for it... Hmm, well then... Phew, here we go...Åh
6473:ShinkÅgWhat are you...Åh
6474:Rin kept looking at the penis with a smile on her face, then she opened her mouth wide and took the meat stick into her mouth completely.
6475:RinÅgMmm, mmm, mmm... Mmmmmmmmmmmm... Oooooh, oooh, oooh...!Åh
6476:ShinkÅg...Oh, oh oh...!Åh
6477::Rin suck the penis completely in her mouth, shakes her face widely and squeezes it with her mouth.
6478:The penis which has just ejaculation moments ago is sensative to the warmth of her mouth, sprayed the scent of semen all over Rin.
6479:RinÅgNgggghh, ssshhhh... Mmm, it's a little painful but... Nggg, hah, it tastes like semen...Åh
6480:RinÅgHere... You can move too, Mr. Shink... Slurp... Let me drink... drink your semen one more time...!Åh
6481:ShinkÅg...Even if you say that...ÅIÅh
6482:Rin seems painful but she continues to use her tongue in her mouth to lick around the penis.
6483:The pressure on her cheeks and the feeling of her crawling tongue hits me so hard that I feel like my hips are going to shatter.
6484:Rin's oral assault blows me out of reason, and I begin to buck my hips for my own pleasure.
6485:RinÅgNghhhh, ssshhhh... Nggg, it's good, mmmm.... Your penis is, very hot...!Åh
6486:RinÅgIt's getting bigger and bigger... Mmmmnnnn... Oh!Åh
6487:ShinkÅgAh, Rin, I am already...Åh
6488:RinÅgMmm, mmm, mmmm... So you're about to cum... Pyuu, pyu... It's good, please let it out like this...!Åh
6489:RinÅgNyu, nghh... I'm always ready for you... nghh...!Åh
6490:RinÅgWhen you want to, Mr Shink... You can... inside my mouth... Fill me up with your semen...!Åh
6491:Lynn smoothly and smoothly clamps down on the penis, as if she's getting used to it, even while taking it deep into her throat.
6492:Her rough tongue opens the bell mouth, licks off the overflowing pre-cum, and tries to suck the sperm out of the back.
6493::The suction force of the tongue causes the sperm, which has been waiting to be released from the back, to run around inside the penis and roilling like coil.
6494:RinÅgNjyu, nghh... Your dick is, shaking and trembling... Please let it out... let it out please!Åh
6495:RinÅgNnnggg... Inside my mouth... Nnnggg...! Please fill me up Mr Shink with your semen...!!Åh
6496:RinÅgNyu, nghh... Nnnggg...! !Åh
6497:ShinkÅgAggghhhh!Åh
6498:The impact of the vigorous sucking as a finishing blow causes me to release a large amount of semen into Rin's mouth.
6499:RinÅgNmbuuuuu...!? Ngggghhhh... Oh, nghhhh, zhulu...!Åh
6500:RinÅgNghhhh, nghhhh... It is a lot... Nghhhh, zhulu...!Å@It is tangled... in the throat, ngghh...Åh
6501:Rin drinks up all the spewed semen, taking her time to taste it.
6502:Every time her throat moves, the penis inside her mouth is also stimulated and what's left inside is being sucked out bit by bit.
6503:I continue to watch the scene, feeling somewhat comfortable at the same time feeling tired from the ejaculation.
6504:RinÅgNghhhh, ssshhhh... Nggg, kkkk, nghh, now that is... all of them... zhulu!Åh
6505:After drinking all the semen, Rin takes her mouth off the meat stick and smiles at me.
6506:The sight of her makes my heart pound, but I hastily shake my head and deny the thought.
6507:RinÅgHmm... If there is another chance, please let me drink your semen again!Åh
6508:ShinkÅg...Åh
6509:If if you looking at me with a beaming face, how can I answer such question like that...
6510:I stood up slow, with my free body, with the sight of innocent Rin in my eyes. 
6511:ShinkÅgHuh, huh... you know what...Åh
6512:RinÅgI am sorry... I could not resisit it...Åh
6513:ShinkÅg......SignÅh
6514:After the oral sex, I exhaled roughly and glare lightly at Lynn.
6515:Lynn shushes, looks away, and apologizes.
6516:After seeing this sight, I simplely could not get angry anymore.
6517:ShinkÅgAnyway... Rin you should warm yourself... I am getting out.Åh
6518:RinÅgBut...Åh
6519:ShinkÅgJust listen to me... What's the point if you get sick?Åh
6520:RinÅgAh... Mr Shink...  Are you angry...?Åh
6521:ShinkÅg... I would be lying if I said I am not angry, but... I am reponsible for this time too... so that's that.Åh
6522:ShinkÅgPlease don't do this kind of things in the future...Åh
6523:She also cared for me while I fainted but I couldn't say that. 
6524:Otherwise it would not be right to be so angry at her.
6525:RinÅgOh, yes. I'll be careful.Åh
6526:ShinkÅgGood, well then... Take your time.Åh
6527:RinÅgYesÅh
6528:Perhaps being reassured by my words, Rin regained her normal posture and soaked herself in the bathtub, laughing.
6529:After confirming this, I hurried out of the bathroom.
6530:ShinkÅgLet's go check on Comet then.Åh
6531:I think she is going to be engrossed in her books so she would not do anything to me, but I am a little worried. 
6532:Besides I am interested in what is in store in this estate too.
6533:ShinkÅgThen, let's get going if it's decided.Åh
6534:Uncharacteristically, I get a little excited and get up and walk out of the room.
6535:Maybe I like to read books too?
6536:ShinkÅgEh...here?Åh
6537:I asked Kyute about the place and come to where the comet is, and I'm left wondering about this space.
6538:I mean, isn't this a food pantry...? (They recycled this asset from the previous game, the previous game featured an female cyclops living in here)
6539:CometÅg...Åh
6540:Not caring about such things, Comet was reading a book with a serious expression on his face, oblivious to my visit.
6541:ShinkÅgUh, Comet?Åh
6542:CometÅgYes...? Oh it was the teacher. I was wondering who it wasÅh
6543:ShinkÅgOh sorry. Am I bothering you?Åh
6544:CometÅgNo, if it is Shink then it is no problem. Rather, I should say welcome.Åh
6545:ShinkÅgI see.Åh
6546:That's a relief. I wouldn't want Comet to be in a bad mood because I interrupted her.
6547:ShinkÅgSo, what are you reading?Åh
6548:CometÅgThis. It is very interesting indeed.Åh
6549:ShinkÅgLet me see... The World's Food Compedium...?Åh
6550:What can I say, she is reading something weird again...
6551:ShinkÅgIs that interesting?Åh
6552:CometÅgYes. Not to mention about the content... The memo is exceptional.Åh
6553:ShinkÅgMemo...?Åh
6554:CometÅgHere. When I read it, I really feel like I'm eating. It's wonderful.Åh
6555:ShinkÅgLet me see...Åh
6556:I look at the book that she offers me without closing it, and start to read the note or whatever it is.
6557:It describes in detail how to cook it, how to season it, when to eat it, and so on.
6558:Sure enough, this is detailed... I'm getting hungry just reading it. 
6559:ShinkÅgThe person must really like eating... Whoever the owner is...Åh(Again I believe this is the cameo appearance about the previous game, Mamono Musume Kumo to Tori)
6560:CometÅgI would love to learn a thing from her. She must be some important figure, to be able to leave such knowledgeable notes.Åh
6561:ShinkÅgOh...I see...Åh
6562:It must be that she likes this note so much, Comet is more bouncy than I would normally imagine.
6563:Her eyes are shining and you can feel the joy in the body.
6564:ShinkÅgI guess Comet could make this kind of face too.Åh
6565:CometÅgHey. I am a creature with feelings too. It's natural for me to be happy and joyful.Åh
6566:ShinkÅgAh, right. Sorry...Åh
6567:Even though I am a puppet, a Comet is still Comet.
6568:It doesn't feel good to hear someone saying this to the face.
6569:CometÅgSorry, I was a little excited. But i really don't get tired of reading this.Åh
6570:ShinkÅgIs that so. That's good to hear.Åh
6571:CometÅgYes. So, what is the teaching doing here...?Åh
6572:ShinkÅgYeah, I think I am going to read somethiing too...Åh
6573:I'm sure there are some history books to read if the house has such a venerable atmosphere.
6574:CometÅgI see. I've got a stack of history books here.Åh
6575:ShinkÅgOh, you're well prepared.Åh
6576:CometÅgI was expecting you. I was also interested in these.Åh
6577:ShinkÅgIs that so?Åh
6578:I did not expect Comet to be intereted in history. 
6579:CometÅgI got interested in them in your class. And also because it is something you like to do.Åh
6580:ShinkÅgOh, I see...Åh
6581:It's kind of embarrassing to hear Comet saying that.
6582:I'm glad to hear that my lessons are getting through to my students.
6583:CometÅgI'm going to read this for a while. You can read it first if you want.Åh
6584:ShinkÅgIs that so? Then I will.Åh
6585:Comet gives me her permission, so I find a suitable book and open it to a page.
6586:This is a very thick book. It seems to be worth reading.
6587:ShinkÅgI see... I didn't know this place was like this...Åh
6588:I don't know how much time has passed since then, but I was concentrating on reading the history book.
6589:It seemed to be quite a valuable resource, and parts of it that I hadn't been able to understand were starting to fill in.
6590:ShinkÅgHmm!Å@I wish I could take the time to read all of this.Åh
6591:CometÅgHmmm... I see what you mean...Åh
6592:ShinkÅgHmm?Åh
6593:I break my concentration and turn my face to the mumbling coming from next to me.
6594:What I see is Comet reading a book, looking more serious than ever.
6595:It looks different from the book she was reading earlier, what book is she reading this time?
6596:ShinkÅgIs it a book on food again?Åh
6597:CometÅgNo, no. I've already read that one.Åh
6598:ShinkÅgThen what are you...?Åh
6599:CometÅgThe wonders of the human body.Åh
6600:ShinkÅgHuh...?Åh
6601:CometÅgWonders of the human body. The book has a lot of stuff about the human body.Åh
6602:ShinkÅgIs that so...Åh
6603:Wonders of the human body... Why are you reading that again...
6604:CometÅgYou are human. I don't know anything about humans. That's why I want to know.Åh
6605:ShinkÅgYou want to know that badly...?Åh
6606:It is true that I know very little about monster bodies.
6607:Of course it's better to know it, but there are so many species that it's hard to keep track of all.
6608:CometÅgI want to you. You said it. Humans and monsters need to coexist from now on.Åh
6609:CometÅgWithout knowledge one cannot do anything. Knowledge itself is an asset.Åh
6610:ShinkÅgOhh.Åh
6611:Comet is indeed a book lover, she sure say good things.
6612:ShinkÅgBut knowledge alone will get into trouble sooner or later.Åh
6613:CometÅgI will worry about it then. I am not interested in practice. Like I said before.Åh
6614:ShinkÅgWell, I heard you...Åh
6615:CometÅgBut I am interested in this. I'd love to put it into practice.Åh
6616:ShinkÅgOh?Å@I wonder what kind of things you want to practice on the human body...?Åh
6617:What would it be... Maybe something about the way blood flows or something about the internal organs...?
6618:No, no, that cannot be... It would be too scary if it were.
6619:CometÅgI think you face look misguided... you are thinking about something weird...Åh
6620:ShinkÅgHa ha ha ... I know...Åh
6621:CometÅgThis is what I'm interested in. Really interesting.Åh
6622:ShinkÅgLet me see... This is...!Åh
6623:I look at the page Comet showed me and I let out a sound out of shocked.
6624:It contains details about male sexuality.
6625:ShinkÅgThen, your practice is going to ...!Åh
6626:At that moment, I a bad feeling ran through my body and... I back away slowly.
6627:CometÅgAs you can imagined. I'd love to put it into practice with our teacher.Åh
6628:ShinkÅgI refuse!Åh
6629:Before I can finish my sentence, I turn my back on Comet and start running in full speed.
6630:I have to get out of here...!
6631:CometÅgI won't let you get away. Take this...!Åh
6632:ShinkÅgWhat...? What is happening?Åh
6633:I hear a disturbing voice and turned my head, only to see Comet's face plunging in front of me.
6634:I tangle my legs with the impact and I fall to the ground.
6635::I can't believe it... This girl... threw her own face at me...!!
6636:CometÅgSo, teacher Shink... Let us begin.Åh
6637:ShinkÅgNo I am not doing this! And don't put your face on me!Åh
6638:CometÅgYou are noisy. Shut up for a minute. Åh
6639:ShinkÅgAhhÅIÅh
6640:Frustrated by my fussing, Comet slammed her face into the body and started to open a book.
6641:I knew what was going to happen, but I couldn't resist her, so I had to stay still.
6642:CometÅgHmmm, this is one way to do it... I will remember this.Åh
6643:ShinkÅgYou're not going to learn... Just let me go as soon as possible...Åh
6644:CometÅgThat's impossible. The teacher is going to practice with me on the wonders of human body.Åh
6645:CometÅgFirst, I need to stimulate your penis... Hmm, this is...It's the same...as we did before...Åh
6646:Comet looks away from the book and rubs her hand on my pants.
6647:The soft penis twitches and quivers under the pressure of Comet's hand, which is slightly harder than the hand of a normal human being.
6648:CometÅgMmm, even over the pants, this reaction... Mmm, slides in and out...Åh
6649:CometÅgKeep at it... Mmm, make him a boner in the pants...Åh
6650:ShinkÅg... Huh, Comet... Huh, stop it... Please, let go of me...Åh
6651:I try to hold back, trying to prevent myself from reacting, but in contrast, the penis that is constantly being rubbed is gradually getting hotter and harder.
6652:Comet continues to rub the slowly expanding penis, curious as to how it feels.
6653:CometÅgNnn, haa... I didn't expect it to grow so big so quickly... Teacher, you have been building up.Åh
6654:ShinkÅg...AhÅh
6655:CometÅgBut this is nice as to move on to the next stage... I didn't get a good look at it last time, so I'll look it closerly today.Åh
6656:Comet makes an interested sound and opens my pants, while I can't move, and my penis is exposed.
6657:CometÅgMmm, it's very big... Interesting...Åh
6658:ShinkÅg...Hmm, stop it Comet...Let go of me...Åh
6659:CometÅgWhat are you talking about? We're just getting started... The real thing starts now...Åh
6660:Comet rejects my words as she looks at my erected penis, which is giving the look as want for more.
6661:I tried to moves my body desperately for resisistance, but penis twitches and twitches repeatedly as Comet looks at it with a sullen gaze, as a result I could not put strength to my body move.
6662:CometÅgNnn, your dick... it is twitching... Are you feeling being watched...?Åh
6663:ShinkÅgAh, of course not...Åh
6664:CometÅgLies. When you shift your gaze, it is where your penis is facing in that direction ... This is a sign that it wants to be seen.Åh
6665:ShinkÅgThat can't be true... Damn...Åh
6666:Comet continues to observe the penis with a serious expresion in her face.
6667:I can vaguely see where her gaze is directed, so I try my best to hold it back so that my penis doesn't react.
6668:CometÅgWell, I can continue to observe and all, but the purpose of today is to practice... so it is time to start without delay.Åh
6669:ShinkÅgAhh.. what are you going to...Åh
6670:CometÅgYou'll see... I will use, my hand like this...Åh
6671:As soon as she let the words out, Comet's hand touches me on the penis, it feels somewhat soft but hard as well.
6672:As it is being gripped, it jumps up, trying to repel Comet's hand.
6673:CometÅgHmmm, just touch it... it's already jerking and shaking. Then if I do this it probably will ejaculate right away...Åh
6674:CometÅgMmm, I'm rubbing the stick... and rubbing the balls... mmm, it makes it easier to get pleasure....Åh
6675:CometÅgI see... Then, let's get started...Åh
6676:Comet reads the book and gives stimulation to the penis as it is written in the book.
6677:The softly gripped penis is being rubbed up and down, and the testicles are rubbed over the pants.
6678:Comet's skin is both hard and soft, and the penis responds to her touch with a shudder of pleasure.
6679:CometÅgNn, ha... It's getting very hot... Hmm, the book didn't say that it was this hot...Åh
6680:CometÅgI knew it, ku... Practice is different... Yes, now I can see the difference from theory...Åh
6681:ShinkÅgAh...!Åh
6682:The penis is handled gently, and small increments of pleasure continue to be given intermittently.
6683:Itis being stroked from the shaft, and the glans is touched, and at the same time, the testicles are gripped.
6684:All these combined stimulations cause the accumulated semen to run through the penis and overflowing, seeking an exit to the tip.
6685:CometÅgHuhu, I am seeing patience juice... MMM, at this rate... it is going straight to... ejaculation isn't it...Åh
6686:CometÅgLook, you should move your penis without holding back, too, teacher...Åh
6687:ShinkÅgGaa, who is going to do that...Åh
6688:Comet makes a teasing remark as she sees my pre-cum overflowing, and she expects me to move on my own.
6689:But I am going to ignore it. I am biting my lip and try to hold down my quivering penis.
6690:CometÅgKuku, you are trying your best... But, ... it is useless... Nnn, the way the teach is feeling is obvious...Åh
6691:CometÅgHere, like this... If I rub your penis and at the same time, see... and also holding the balls...Åh
6692:ShinkÅgAagh...!Åh
6693:CometÅgHmph, just as I thought. I think you it more... when I stimulate you harder...Åh
6694:CometÅgYour penis is ... shuddering and trembling... I can smell your scent on my face...Åh
6695:Comet squeezes my testicles as if to carefully timing it, also squeezeing my balls.
6696:I can't resist the rhythmic stimulation, and I lift my hips, shaking my penis intensely.
6697:CometÅgMmm, your penis is shaking louder and louder... Mmm, haha, is it time to ejaculate...?Åh
6698:CometÅgDon't worry about me, just ejaculate as you would naturally... I will make sure to observe it to the end...Åh
6699:ShinkÅgAhh, you said that... I'm not going to let it out...!Åh
6700:The truth is, just like what Comet said, the penis is still trembling and shaking, it is so swollen that it looks like it is about to ejaculate.
6701:I try to move my body to escape from Comet, holding back the cum that is coming up.
6702:CometÅgHmm, stubborn... but to no avail... You can't do anything if your penis is being held... See...!Åh
6703:ShinkÅgKuh...!?Åh
6704:As soon as I move my body to try to escape, she grips my penis tightly.
6705:I feel my body relax and my hips jump up reflexively.
6706:CometÅg"You're not going to get out of here... I will let it out quickly... Show me your ejaculation...!Åh
6707:ShinkÅgGgh, Comet... Please, if you hold it that hard...!Åh
6708:CometÅgIf I don't use force it will not come out... Mmm, I am going to get it all out...Åh
6709:Comet rubs up and down on my penis forcefully, and grips my testicles with such force that it feels like she is going to crush my testicles.
6710:Although she looks fragile, her strength is stronger than a human's, and a tingling pleasure runs up and down my spine.

8442:RinÅgHuff. I'm finally done.Åh
8443:MiritaÅgIt's kind of last minute for me...Åh
8444:CometÅgNo problem. On schedule.Åh
8445:ShireneÅgAnother one of those easily recognizable lies...Åh
8446:CometÅgI'm not lying. There is nothing wrong with my schedule. I've already planned to include playing time too.Åh
8447:RinÅgOh, haha... I hope you can finish it.Åh
8448:MiritaÅgRight. Hah~ Now all I have to do is get ready for the new semester and I guess the vacation is over.Åh
8449:When I went to the cafeteria, Rin and the others were just taking a break to see if they had finished their assignments.
8450:Seems everyone is going to make it.
8451:ShinkÅgEveryone good job.Åh
8452:RinÅgOh, Mr Shink! What are you up to?Åh
8453:ShinkÅgYou know, just wondering if everyone has finished your assignment.Åh
8454:MiritaÅgI finished it just now. Your assignment was difficult.Åh
8455:ShinkÅgOh, is it...? Sorry about that.Åh
8456:Was it that difficult...?
8457:ShireneÅgFor me, Kyute's assignment was more difficult.Åh
8458:CometÅgI agree. Some of the questions were wrong in places and I couldn't solve them. Shocking.Åh
8459:ShinkÅg......Åh
8460:Please don't make mistakes in the assignment, Kyute...
8461:RinÅgYou know, I heard they noticed it and made a page replacement...Åh
8462:ShinkÅgOh... So that's why it's like that.Åh
8463:At Rin's words, I turn my attention to Ms Kyute, who is plopped down on the table.
8464:It's a lot of work just to make an assignment, but to make a replacement page while on vacation... It must have taken a lot out of her spirit.
8465:ShinkÅgHaha, it must be tough for you.Åh
8466:KyuteÅgYes...I'm so tired... Ugh, how did this happen...Åh
8467:When I call out to him, Ms Kyute doesn't even look up, groaning in pain. 
8468:She seems stressed out... I guess I should just leave her alone.
8469:ShinkÅgWell, I shall leave her at that... The problem is...Åh
8470:I mutterred to myself and look in one direction.
8471:VeraÅgAh, boring... Still a lot of assignment is not done yet.Åh
8472:BibiÅgWhat a coincidence. Me too.Åh
8473:VeraÅgNo~, to be honest, I think I played too much.Å@I'm going to have to get serious to finish it...Åh
8474:ShinkÅgI knew you girls would be like this...Åh
8475:I heard Vera and Bibi talking and I walked up to them, trying to suppress my headache.
8476:They sure know how to meet my expectations.
8477:ShinkÅgI am telling you two ... Get the work done alright?Åh
8478:VeraÅgHmm?Å@Oh, it's fine, it's fine. If I get serious this amount of homework is a piece of cake.Åh
8479:BibiÅgThen I will copy it. A perfect plan.Åh
8480:ShinkÅgYou copy...Åh
8481:She is not even going to attempt to do it...
8482:Oh well whatever... She won't listen to me anyway...
8483:She can learn it by copying it alone. 
8484:VeraÅgI've always wondered... Is there no one else who let you copy the assignment?Åh
8485:BibiÅgNo one. They are all so guarded and they don't like it.Åh
8486:ShinkÅgNo, because you're trying to copy the whole thing...Åh
8487:I am sure they can forgive you if it is some part of it...
8488:BibiÅgDon't say that. So, I'm looking forward to seeing you again this year, Vera.Åh
8489:VeraÅgNo problem. Well, just give me a few days and I'll get it all done, then you can do whatever you like.Åh
8490:Vera responds with an unmotivated pitter-pattering of her feet, as if she's used to Bibi's attitude or she just doesn't care.
8491:How can she be so lazy...
8492:KyuteÅgAh! I just remembered something!Åh
8493:ShinkÅgOh that was sudden... What's the matter Ms Kyute, shouting all of a sudden?...Åh
8494:KyuteÅgNo no, I just remembered something that is all...Åh
8495:KyuteÅgMr. Shink, are you free later?Åh
8496:ShinkÅgAfter this? Yes, I don't have anything to do...Åh
8497:Kyute smiles as she heard my response, and then starts talking to Rin and the others.
8498:KyuteÅgHow about Rin and the others, do you have time after?Åh
8499:RinÅgEh...?Å@Yes, we're fine, but...Åh
8500:ShireneÅgWhat is going on? Is this for some kind of event?Åh
8501:KyuteÅgNot so much of an event, but why don't we all take a picture together?Åh
8502:MiritaÅgPhoto? Why are you suddenly taking pictures again...Åh
8503:CometÅgDon't tell me... You are going to use it for some kind of spells... Ms Kyute you are such a scary person...!Åh
8504:KyuteÅgOf course not! We are going to take a commemorative photo together!Åh
8505:ShinkÅgCommemorative photo?Åh
8506:KyuteÅgYes! I wanted to do this as soon you have arrived here, but back then everyone did not like you so much...Åh
8507:KyuteÅgThen I had forgotten about taking the photo, but now I believe it would be a good time.Åh
8508:ShinkÅgI see...Åh
8509:Unlike when I was first assigned here, we are reasonably close now, and I don't think they would reject me.
8510:But even though I am fine, I wonder what everyone else would say...
8511:VeraÅgOh!Å@Nice nice nice! I'm so excited that we're all getting our picture taken together!Åh
8512:BibiÅgHmmm, certainly not a bad idea. Then I'll be next to the teacher.Åh
8513:RinÅgWait a minute! Why is Bibi next to Mr Shink?Åh
8514:CometÅgThat's right. I will be next to Shink and that's final.Åh
8515:RinÅgComent you too! That is not right! I will be next to Mr Shink!Åh
8516:BibiÅgWell well. I wonder what are these two little girls trying to show offÅh
8517:RinÅgWho is little girls! We are the same age!Åh
8518:ShinkÅgOh, hey...there's no need to fight...Åh
8519:CometÅgMr Shink please be quiet. This is between us.Åh
8520:ShinkÅgWhat?Åh
8521:No, that's my problem too... Why am I being excluded?
8522:ShireneÅgOn come on! Fighting for where to stand in the photo is so embrassing...Åh
8523:MiritaÅgHaha... I can get how they feel. But I'll pass.Åh
8524:VeraÅgThese things don't matter... We should take the picture soon!Åh
8525:RinÅgWhat do you mean it doesn't matter!Å@This is very important!Åh
8526:CometÅgExtremely important. It will decide the futre my the shcool life.Åh
8527:That sounds a bit too much...
8528:KyuteÅgFine, fine. Do decide it by whatever means. If you don't do it quickly, I'll stop the photo shooting.Åh
8529:RinÅg...Ah!Å@Hey, Comet! We have no choice here, so let's join forces!Åh
8530:CometÅgI agree. Bibi is the only enemy. If we join forces, we will be invinsible.Åh
8531:BibiÅgOh, oh... you girls are going that far?Åh
8532:I agree. I mean, Bibi seems turned off a bit...
8533:VeraÅgHow about we let the two girls be next to the Shink?Åh
8534:BibiÅgYou are right... it's getting ridiculous.Åh
8535:ShireneÅgGosh... why are we wasting time on these things...Åh
8536:MiritaÅgAhaha...Åh
8537:RinÅgWe did it!Å@We did it, Comet! We won!Åh
8538:CometÅgI don't know if I should this, but... Rin that's a little gross.Åh
8539:RinÅgWhat!? How can you say that!Åh
8540:KyuteÅgThat's enough! Since you are done let's get on with the shooting!Åh
8541:Following Kyute's voice, everyone walks out.
8542:What can I say, I'm a little worried about everything is going so well...
8543:ShinkÅgSomehow I feel taking a photo normally will not be so easy.Åh
8544:That was my intuition. I too walk out the room so that I don't fall behind.
8545:...Everything is going to fine right?
8546:KyuteÅgYes, please line up properly!Åh
8547:ShinkÅgOh, am I right in the middle?Åh
8548:RinÅgOf course. Mr Shink is the star of the show.Åh
8549:CometÅgYes. The teacher is in the middle. This is non-negotiable.Åh
8550:ShinkÅgOkay. That's fine then.Åh
8551:We went outside, lining up and picking our spots.ÅB
8552:I feel like I should not be in the middle, but I guess it's okay...if these two say so.
8553:ShireneÅgBibi, are you going to take a picture while floating?Åh
8554:BibiÅgYes. Don't you think this suits me more?Åh
8555:MiritaÅgUmmm...I wonder if it's ok. Will the picture be clear?Åh
8556:VeraÅgNo problem! I'm in the middle too, so no need to worry about it!Åh
8557:MiritaÅgNo, no, no!Å@I'm talking about Bibi now!Åh
8558:KyuteÅgHehe I am glad everyone is so energetic.Åh
8559:ShinkÅgenergetic...? I would say noisy...Åh
8560:CometÅgI completely agree. Please be quiet.Åh
8561:RinÅgHeh heh. I'm happy to be next to Mr. Shink.Åh
8562:ShireneÅgWe seem to be talking at cross-purposes... I wonder if it's okay.Åh
8563:BibiÅgHaha I think it's fine. I'm looking forward now to seeing what's going to happen.Åh
8564:I heard some disturbing words, but eveyone takes the position, waiting for the shutter to be pressed.
8565:KyuteÅgThen... I am going to press the shutter!Åh
8566:The shutter is pressed with Kyute's signal, and the sound of the timer echoes.
8567:As she has calculated it carefully, as soon as Kyute has float to the right spot, the timer turns zero...
8568:VeraÅgYes!Å@I'll be the one that stand out most!Åh
8569:ShinkÅgWhat!?Åh
8570:CometÅgOh...my head!?Åh
8571:MiritaÅgWa!? A head! A head is flying towards me!?Åh
8572:RinÅgHey, Mr Shink!Å@The hug is so sudden!Åh
8573:ShinkÅgI am sorry... Vera get out of the way!Åh
8574:VeraÅgNo way!Å@I want to be the most prominent one in the picture!Åh
8575:ShireneÅgWhat are you people doing...Åh
8576:BibiÅgHaha I knew it. I am the winner for being able to anticipate this farce.Åh
8577:KyuteÅgOh my goodness, even making a pose, you are so astute.Åh
8578:ShinkÅgYou're kidding right! Among this mess!?Åh
8579:The sounds of the shutter echoed as we are making all kind of different noise in this mess.
8580:PhamÅgAm I in?Åh
8581:ShinkÅgHeyÅIÅh
8582:Pham is here too!? This is too much!!
8583:VeraÅgOh no...!Åh
8584:ShinkÅgGah!?Åh
8585:The moment I try to get back into position, Vera crashes into me.
8586:Of course, I lost my balance...
8587:We all fell down to the ground.
8588:Man...even the new school year has just started...I can already sense plenty of turbulence ahead...
8589:And then true school life began with that photo being shoot.
8590:We keep getting to know each other better through various events...and then everyone just graduated as it is.
8591:Everyone who was considered a problem child have graduated, and I was thrilled with joy, too.
8592:And with that sentiment not fading... my new chapter of school life has began.
8593:I am sure that... the same days will be repeated for a long time to come.
8594:PhamÅgHi there. Welcome to Pham's ending lecture number two.Åh
8595:PhamÅgThis is a rare ending lecture! You're very lucky to have made it here.Åh
8596:PhamÅgWell, it is a bad ending though.Åh
8597:PhamÅgBut why, you ask!? Because you tried to go after a sub-heroine first.Åh
8598:PhamÅgThings must be done in the proper order, you see. You have to clear a main heroine route first.Åh
8599:PhamÅgNow go back and fix your mistake. Work hard, I have high expectations for you.Åh
8600:PhamÅgIf you make it to the end, you might even learn my true identity.Åh
8601:PhamÅgBye bye!Åh
